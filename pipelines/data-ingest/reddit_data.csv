dt0ucg,I analyzed James Harden's performance in every NBA city to see if there is a correlation between his box score and the city's average strip club rating.,"Everyone knows James Harden has a particular affinity for the Canadian ballet, aka strip clubs. After the Rocket's dismal performance in Miami last week, and the city's reputation for high quality tit-shacks, I became increasingly curious to see just how much James Harden's vice affects his game.  So here we are, I spent the better part of the week on this, hope y'all enjoy!

**Hypothesis**: James Harden's box score declines in cities with high quality strip clubs

**Test**: Analyze James Harden's performance in every NBA city and correlate with those cities' reputation for strip clubs to see if there is any discernible relationship.

&#x200B;

**Methodology/Steps**:

* First I extracted all of James Harden's game logs for the past 4 seasons from Basketball Reference, cleaned up the data a bit (a bunch), and appended it into a single worksheet.
* Next, I filtered out all Home games and all games Harden was inactive or DNP. For the purpose of this analysis we did not look at home games.
* **Poor Performances** were determined by variances in 6 stats: Points, FG%, 3PT%, FT%, Assists and Turnovers. For each of these stats I compared Harden's *overall* season average to the *city-specific* season average. I identified 2 categories of poor performances:

1. Sub-Par - Harden performed WORSE than season average, and
2. Very Sub-Par - Harden performed 20%+ WORSE than season average.

* I analyzed his poor performances across each of the NBA’s 28 different cities (did not look at home games so no Houston, there are 2 teams in LA, and I distinguished between Brooklyn and NYC = 28 cities).
* **City Strip Club Rating** was determined by the average google review rating for the first 10 strip clubs in each city based on the google search “\[CITY\] Strip Clubs” (e.g., “Detroit Strip clubs”). Yes, this did involve me making like 30+ searches for strip clubs on my cpu...
* Finally, I put the City Strip Club Rating into the pivoted game log data, performed a regression analysis and visualized it into charts.

&#x200B;

**Conclusion**:

>!I have proven, to a statistically significant degree, that James Harden’s game performance declines in cities with higher rated strip clubs. !<

>!Correlation Coefficient - r - (between avg strip club rating and total # of sub-par games) = .4575!<

* >!Given the nature of the subject matter, this would be considered a moderate-to-strong correlation. !<

>!Coefficient of Determination - r2 - (between avg strip club rating and total # of sub-par games) = .21!<

* >!This means that James Harden’s box score is 20% predictable based on the quality of a city’s strip clubs !<

>!Other interesting facts: !<

* >!Harden’s best performance comes in city with the worst strip clubs - Toronto!<
* >!Harden’s worst performance comes in city with the best strip clubs - Miami!<
* >!Salt Lake city has the 3rd-ranked strip clubs of all NBA cities lol!<

10nbau4,Memphis Grizzlies scorekeeper posting fraudulent numbers,"MEMPHIS GRIZZLIES SCOREKEEPER POSTING FRAUDULENT NUMBERS FOR DEFENSIVE PLAYER OF THE YEAR LEADER JAREN JACKSON JR. 

I would like to bring to your attention the scorekeeper of the Memphis Grizzlies.  I was wondering how a solid defensive player can suddenly have some specific statistical categories that are completely off the charts.  I am referring to Jaren Jackson Jr., who, after having missed ~16 games to start the season due to off-season foot surgery immediately started having extreme outlier high steals + blocks statistics, leading the entire NBA in blocks per game by a wide margin.  In fewer minutes per game than other players Jaron Jackson repeatedly gets outlandish block numbers at home. 

I decided to take a closer look at his games and IMMEDIATELY 1 thing became crystal clear.  At home in Memphis he has 66 blocks in 16 home games, averaging 4.13 blocks per game, versus just 35 in 16 road games, averaging 2.19 in nearly identical minutes- an 89% increase in Memphis.  In home games he has been credited with 22 steals in 16 home games, versus only 10 steals in 16 road games.  This means he is averaging nearly 1.4 steals per game at home, but just 0.63 steals on the road per game- an astounding 120% increase in Memphis.  In home games he has been credited with 88 blocks + steals, versus 45 on the road.  This equates to an average of an outlandish 5.5 blocks+steals at home in limited minutes versus a reasonable and realistic, and still outstanding, 2.81 steals+blocks per game on the road.  This equates to a 1.96X home stat increase only in these 2 categories.  A 96% increase in performance specifically at home is truly an aberration which should be reviewed.  This demonstrates the sort of incredulous statistics which calls for serious analysis. 

Just 3 out of his 14 games this season with 5+ blocks+steals have come on the road.  8 out of 9 of his 6+ steals+blocks games have been recorded in Memphis.  I decided to watch 2 memphis grizzlies games where he had one of his ludicrous 8+ blocks+steals games.  By my count he actually had 3 fewer ""stocks""(some people refer to steals+blocks as stocks) than he was credited for by the home scorekeeper.  I wonder if the scorekeeper has some sort of vested interest in Jaren Jackson getting maximum high value defensive statistics that he thinks he can get away with putting down into the box score.  

Jaren Jackson in July - mid November started as high as +10,000 for DPOY at certain sportsbooks after the Grizzlies announced he had undergone a procedure to address a stress fracture in his right foot and would be sidelined for 4-6 months.  Now, in large part thanks to these blatantly wrong statistics, he is a huge odds on favorite at higher than -200. 

I conducted some analysis on all 78 games jaren jackson played last season... my hypothesis was that his home/road difference on steals & blocks would both be small.  He had 90 blocks in Memphis and 87 blocks on the road.  He had 39 steals in Memphis and 34 steals on the road.  He had 129 ""stocks"" in Memphis vs. 121 ""stocks"" on the road.  BPG was actually 12.7% lower on the road(he played 4 fewer home games) while steals+blocks/game was 15% lower on the road- higher than i expected, but reasonable given all the differences for Memphis when playing at home vs on the road, from their home/away record difference to crowd noise to effort/energy/intensity exerted by players, etc.
90%+ higher in Memphis, however, as is the case this season, is NOT REASONABLE AND COMPLETELY UNREALISTIC.  My educated guess is that the Memphis scorekeeper(s) have been changed since last season and/or ULTERIOR MOTIVES, INCENTIVES are now in play with respect to JJJ's defensive statistics. 

Why is this happening so blatantly to the point where a person can just look at Jaren Jackson Jrs. steals+blocks #s on the box score and determine with a high level of confidence whether that game was played on the road or in Memphis is the next question... 

Three potential explanations, only one of which is innocent: 

1. Jaren Jackson plays MUCH MUCH MUCH harder at home and hustles like a maniac and focuses on stealing and blocking shots like crazy in Memphis, causing his numbers to be skewed in an absurd manner even compared to his regular highly efficient top 3- but realistic, road numbers. This can almost certainly be discounted because i looked at his other statistics and everything from his minutes per game to points per game to rebounds per game and even fouls are close in terms of home/away splits. 

2. The Memphis scorekeeper is a huge Jaren Jackson Jr. fan and is purposely imbellishing his steals & blocks, since that is much easier to do than points or rebounds, for instance.  When he contests a shot well, but does not touch the ball, perhaps the scorekeeper purposely gives him the undeserved stat and donates blocks to him where none occurred, for instance. 

3. It should also be investigated in this age of fantasy basketball and gambling on sports whether this scorekeeper and/or his family and friends bet on Jaren Jackson to win the defensive player of the year award at super long odds and as a result has a tremendous financial incentive to juice and fake a player's 2 most valuable defensive statistics- BLOCKS and STEALS, which are also the easiest to fudge #s on because it is often most difficult to definitively label steals and blocks without slow motion on at least some of the plays in question. 

I and all NBA fans would appreciate a thorough investigation into this matter.  It is important to have 100% integrity in statistics not only for things such as fantasy sports, sportsbetting, futures wagers, but even more importantly to ENSURE THE INTEGRITY OF THE GAME FOR ALL.  This is mandatory to be able to compare players' statistics versus other players now in the league fairly as well as across seasons and know the numbers are accurate, correct, and not unfairly manipulated by home arena scorekeepers. 

I decided to watch just a few of the Grizzlies' recent games and immediately started noticing a pattern: Plays at FedEx arena in Memphis constantly being scored wrongly to gift Jackson extra steals and blocks which never occurred.  Simply put, if a shot does not hit the rim or it otherwise looks bad somehow, and Jaren Jackson is either contesting the shot or close to the action, he is credited with FRAUDULENT blocks repeatedly.  Sometimes this is achieved by taking away the stat from his teammates. Other times, an opposing player simply loses the ball or shoots a contested shot way off target, but Jackson nevertheless is credited with steals & blocks that never occurred in both instances.  Also, when he deflects a ball and it goes to a teammate he is credited with the steal.  When his teammate deflects the ball and it goes to him he is STILL credited with the steal IN MEMPHIS.  When he tips or deflects a ball, but never gains possession nor do the Grizzlies, he is still awarded a steal. 

The following is just a very small % of questionable or outright WRONG steals and blocks given to Jackson: 

Example #1 New Orleans Pelicans @ Memphis Grizzlies 
Saturday 12/31
7mins, 21 sec remaining in the 2nd quarter
Zion drives to the basket, NEVER shoots the ball, and loses it. ""Williamson in a crowd, ball pops free, picked up by Tyus Jones, turnover number 9 by the pelicans"" announcers say.  Scorekeeper in Memphis graded the play as Jaren Jackson Jr. blocks Zion Williamson's 3-foot driving layup 

Example #2 Utah Jazz @ Memphis Grizzlies 
Sunday 1/8 
10:09 remaining in the 1st quarter
Jordan Clarkson throws a bad pass directly to Desmond Bane and Jaren Jackson for some odd reason is credited with the steal.  Bane actually steals the ball. 

Example #3 Utah Jazz @ Memphis Grizzlies
Sunday 1/8
1:46 remaining in the 4th quarter
Kelly Olynyk loses the ball while being defended by Xavier Tillman.  The ball then bounces off Tillman and Jaren Jackson before being picked up by Tillman. The steal should be credited to Tillman.  Memphis scorekeeper grades the play as Jaren Jackson Jr. steals 

Example #4 Phoenix Suns @ Memphis Grizzlies
Monday 1/16
7:02 remaining in the 4th quarter
Brandon Clarke blocks Saban Lee's layup, but the Memphis scorekeeper instantly gives the block to nearby Jaren Jackson Jr. 

Example #5 Cleveland Cavaliers @ Memphis Grizzlies
Wednesday 1/18
11:48 remaining in the 2nd quarter
Lamar Stevens, who Jaren Jackson helps on, loses the ball and Desmond Bane picks it up and gains possession.  The Memphis scorekeeper gave steal to Jaren Jackson. 

Example #6 Detroit Pistons @ Memphis Grizzlies
Friday, December 9th
39 seconds remaining in the 2nd quarter
Jackson deflects a pass and never gains possession, saved back to Detroit player. Memphis scorekeeper gives a steal to Jackson. 

Example #7 Oklahoma City Thunder @ Memphis Grizzlies
Wednesday, December 7th
10:38 4th quarter
Jackson saves out of bounds ball directly to Thunder player underneath basket for quick score, but gets credited with a steal. 

Thank you very much for reading this.  I would appreciate well thought out responses, a good discussion, and also advice on how someone in charge at the NBA can investigate these plays as well as others from Grizzlies games, and the dishonest Memphis scorekeeper.  Also, can obviously fraudulent statistics be deleted, corrected & reversed weeks/months later?",66981,4101,AdMassive6666,2023-01-28 09:42:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/10nbau4/memphis_grizzlies_scorekeeper_posting_fraudulent/,0.89,False,False,False,False

rpr4vd,"[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar] While LeBron James is a necessary and dynamic voice critical of police brutality against the Black community, he needs to be the same necessary and dynamic advocate with vaccines, which could save thousands of Black lives right now.","[Source](https://kareem.substack.com/p/dear-lebron-heres-the-covid-19-help)

> LeBron James is not only one of the greatest basketball players ever, he’s committed to being a leader in the African American community in the fight against inequality. But his Thursday Instagram meme showing three cartoon Spider-Men pointing at each other—one labeled “covid,” one labeled “flu,” one labeled “cold”—with his message: “Help me out folks” was a blow to his worthy legacy. The meme’s implication is that LeBron doesn’t understand the difference among these three illnesses, even after all the information that’s been presented in the press. Well, since he asked, let me help him out by explaining the difference—and how knowing that difference might save lives, especially in the Black community.
> 
 -----
> 
> First, let’s put his meme in context. In September, LeBron stated: “I don’t talk about other people and what they should do. We’re talking about individual bodies. We’re not talking about something political or racism or police brutality. I don’t think I personally should get involved in what other people do for their bodies and livelihoods ... I know what I did for me and my family ... But as far as speaking for everybody and their individualities and things they want to do, that’s not my job.”
> 
> Here’s the first problem with that statement: With 106 million Instagram followers, making such a post is automatically politically impactful because he questions the validity of the efforts to get the country vaccinated. As is evident by some of the comments that cheer LeBron’s post, he’s given support to those not getting vaccinated, which makes the situation for all of worse by postponing our health and economic recovery. The CDC reports that those who are unvaccinated are 9 times more likely to be admitted to the hospital and 14 times more likely to die from COVID than those vaccinated. The number rises to 20 time more likely when compared to someone who’s gotten a booster shot. By posting the uninformed meme, LeBron has encouraged vaccine hesitancy which puts lives and livelihoods at risk.
> 
> Here’s the second problem with that statement: He says we’re not talking about racism, but we most definitely are. As of December 2020, about 97.9 out of every 100,000 African Americans had died from COVID-19, a third higher than that for Latinos (64.7 per 100,000), and more than double than that for whites (46.6 per 100,000) and Asians (40.4 per 100,000). According to an article on the U.S. National Library of Medicine site, “The overrepresentation of African Americans among confirmed COVID-19 cases and number of deaths underscores the fact that the coronavirus pandemic, far from being an equalizer, is amplifying or even worsening existing social inequalities tied to race, class, and access to the health care system.”
> 

---- 

> A year later, the communities of People of Color are still suffering at a much higher rate than white communities. In November 2021, the CDC stated, “It has highlighted that health equity is still not a reality as COVID-19 has unequally affected many racial and ethnic minority groups, putting them more at risk of getting sick and dying from COVID-19.” One study in Atlanta showed 79% of Blacks with COVID-19 were hospitalized versus 13% of whites. COVID-19 has resulted in a drop in life expectancy among whites of 1.2 years. Among the Black and Latinx communities it was more than 3 years.
> 
> For those confident that the Omicron variant may not be as harsh as previous variants, it’s important to realize that, while most might come out of it okay, they can still unwittingly infect others along the way—the elderly, people with compromised immune systems, people with respiratory problems—who could end up hospitalized or dead. Also, almost half of those who recover from initial COVID-19 illness have “long-haul COVID,” with persistent symptoms of brain fog, shortness of breath, fatigue, dizziness, and headaches.
> 
> For those pointing out that there are “breakthrough” cases in which the vaccinated contract COVID-19. Yes, but they also have lighter symptoms and are at a much less risk of dying than the unvaccinated. The crucial statistic here is this: 98-99% of Americans dying of COVID-19 are unvaccinated.
> 

-----

> Vaccine hesitancy is higher in the Black community than in any other. While there are certainly justifiable historical reasons for Blacks to be skeptical of the health care system that has routinely marginalized, ignored, and even illegally experimented on them, that is not enough to justify compromising their health and even losing their lives during the current health crisis.
> 
> To directly address LeBron’s confusion, no one thinks colds and the flu aren’t serious. In the 2019-2020 flu season, 400,000 people were hospitalized and 22,000 people died. In 2020, 385,428 people died of COVID-19, while so far in 2021, 423,558 have died in the U.S., for a total of 808,986 deaths. Experts agree that COVID-19 is at least 10 times more lethal than the flu. As for the common cold, death is extremely rare.
> 
> However, LeBron, if you’re concerned about the flu, then help promote the flu vaccination. In the 2019-2020 flu season, only 51.8% in the U.S. were vaccinated, well below the 70% that is the target. Worse, the vaccination rate is 20% lower among Blacks than whites and as a result they have the highest hospitalization rate due to flu of any other group. This is due to vaccination hesitancy that your meme promotes.
> 
> One way to help the Black community to overcome their hesitancy and save lives is for prominent Black celebrities and influencers to continue to encourage everyone to get vaccinated and their boosters. Immunization, whether from vaccines or having had the disease, lessens over time and makes people vulnerable for reinfection.
> 
> While LeBron is a necessary and dynamic voice critical of police brutality against the Black community, he needs to be the same necessary and dynamic advocate with vaccines, which could save thousands of Black lives right now. The racism is just as real—and just as lethal—in both cases.",42986,2846,GuyCarbonneauGOAT,2021-12-27 16:27:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/rpr4vd/kareem_abduljabbar_while_lebron_james_is_a/,0.78,False,True,False,False

kpaw7d,Can we please stop calling players that 90% of people wouldn’t recognize by their initials?,"KD, AD, MJ, PG, LBJ (I prefer just LeBron but this one’s fine) etc are all easily recognizable. 

Calling Russ RW is annoying because RW literally has the same amount of syllables as his full name, but at least it makes sense because he’s a high profile player? 

BUT BOY DOES IT GRIND MY GEARS WHEN SOMEONE SAYS

 *”Jazz could use someone like SM”*

AND I HAVE TO WASTE 10 MINUTES GOING THROUGH THEIR POST HISTORY AND GOOGLE TO FIND OUT THIS MF WAS TALKING ABOUT *SHAKE MILTON*

If a player is consensus worth talking about, chances are they already have a nickname or we just use their first or last name. 
If they do not, then chances are most people wouldn’t recognize them by a nickname you make up. There is no reason to go against the grain and confuse people.

joovqq,The Charlotte Hornets have a transgender mascot,"Hugo the hornet is the mascot for the Charlotte hornets. His Facebook page lists him as male, he has a male name, but he also has a stinger. Only females have stingers as they are modified ovipositors. This means he must have been born a female, and later transitioned to a male before becoming the mascot for the Charlotte Hornets. I suspect this was kept quiet at the time because transgender individuals dealt with even more bigotry back in 1988 when he was introduced, than they do today. The other possibility is that he is a male hornet, and does not actually have a stinger.

xu2f65,"Kareem Abdul-Jabbar on Kyrie posting about Alex Jones: ""Kyrie Irving would be dismissed as a comical buffoon if it weren’t for his influence over young people who look up to athletes.""","Full bit on Kyrie here:

> There is some irony in this news item coming right after the previous one about the miseducation of American youth. Because Kyrie Irving’s thought process is an example of what happens when the education system fails.

> Last October, I wrote a piece about Kyrie Irving’s refusal to get vaccinated against COVID-19 (“Should We Just ‘Leave Kyrie Alone?”) and why this reckless choice was destructive to the country and especially the Black community where he would be an influential role model. The facts proved that accusation to be true. Irving didn’t care. He continued to promote his anti-vax sentiments—regardless of the cost in lives and health to others—proclaiming himself a “martyr.” Not kidding.

> We might have just left him alone to stew in his own gelatinous ignorance. Rich and famous people get away with saying dumb things all the time because their money isolates them from consequences. They surround themselves with Yes-people whose job is to confirm whatever hare-brained ideas they have. Yes, sir, Mr. Irving, the Earth has never been flatter.

> But now Irving is back and more destructive, insensitive, and just plain silly than before. He decided it would be a good idea to post a 2002 video clip from Infowars founder Alex Jones. Yeah, the guy who has been on trial for denying the Sandy Hook shootings and who previously admitted in open court that he’s a performer and his onscreen persona is just a character (that bilks millions of dollars from unaware viewers). The main gist of the clip is a warning about a cabal of international leaders who are secretly releasing plagues on the world from which they can profit. (Of course, we know who really profits from making this claim.)

> Alex Jones is one of the most despicable human beings alive and to associate with him means you share his stench.

> Kyrie Irving would be dismissed as a comical buffoon if it weren’t for his influence over young people who look up to athletes. When I look at some of the athletes who have used their status to actually improve society—Colin Kaepernick, LeBron James, Muhammad Ali, Bill Russel, Billie Jean King, Arthur Ashe, and more—it becomes clear how much Irving has tarnished the reputations of all athletes who strive to be seen as more than dumb jocks.

> Irving does not seem to have the capacity to change, but we have the capacity to keep fighting against his brand of destructive behavior. One way to do that, beyond shaking our heads and nasty tweets, is to write to his sponsors and tell them to drop Irving—or you will drop them. Nike has likely decided not to renew his contract past this season. But he is still sponsored by Pepsi and 2K Sports. (Don’t feel bad for Irving: his career earnings at the end of the 2022-’23 season will be $230 million. That buys a lot of Yes-people.)

NBA players have been finding their voices, players like Dwight and Patty Mills have opted to donate salary, clearly there is no fear to speak out on important issues throughout a large portion of the league.

But now, when it comes to this, it is only silence. The way I see it, they either know it is wrong and choose to be silent, or they do not know that what he is doing is wrong, and both of these are incredibly disappointing.

f3to7w,[OC] Charles Barkley's Secret: A Critical Analysis," If you have ever had the chance to watch a basketball game on TNT, you might have caught yourself as glued to the half-time show as the actual game. *NBA on TNT* is one of the best sports broadcasts hosted by some of the boldest personalities on TV: Shaquille O’Neil, Ernie Johnson, Kenny Smith, and of course… Charles Barkley. 

There are no subjects off limits and no quarter is given. But there is one topic that never fails to elicit strong consternation from Ernie despite roars of laughter from Shaq— Charles Barkley’s bit about the Big ol Women™ of San Antonio. If you haven’t seen it, here’s one of the best supercuts to catch you up: 

 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7GPuudYY5k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7GPuudYY5k) 

As you can see, Chuck is fascinated with San Antonio — well, with the women and churros of San Antonio at least. He brings up the subject so often that simply googling “San Antonio Women” yields almost exclusively articles and clips of Barkley & Co. discussing the virtues of San Antonio churros, the Big ‘ol Women™ who eat them, and the city’s curious lack of Victoria’s Secret stores.

 

[ google search results for generic query \\""San Antonio Women\\""](https://preview.redd.it/81yphxq1mwg41.png?width=1288&format=png&auto=webp&s=37f18954312ed009a9e3c4d2d6620d7e15a06900)

From his time as a [player](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMzdAZ3TjCA), to his current career as a broadcaster, Barkley is infamous for never minding his tongue. When it comes to making Shaq and the production crew keel over with laughter, it’s clear he has no plans to change his humorous tone, no matter how much Ernie scorns him.  


***But did you ever wonder why… Why is Chuck so fixated on the Big ol Women*****™** ***of San Antonio and their unique pastry/ lingerie inclinations?***

  
***Is there something more behind the man’s obsession?***

So began my search to understand the enigma that is Charles Wade Barkley…

&#x200B;

# The Research

I started out by attempting to confirm or refute Barkley’s suspicions… 

* Does San Antonio have a lot of Big ol Women™? 
* Is Victoria really a “Secret” in San Antonio?, and
* How do fried Spanish pastries play into this whole thing?

Well let’s break it down one-by-one…

 

**San Antonio’s Big ol Women™**

I compared obesity rates for every NBA city to determine if there is any merit to Chuck’s claim that San Antonio has an abundance of plus-sized ladies…

[ NBA cities ranked by Obesity Rates ](https://preview.redd.it/9mm0ytabmwg41.png?width=383&format=png&auto=webp&s=6761f072a5ca61b9a1c7d47d1ae4bc3b9c64aee6)

As it turns out, he is right on point. According to my analysis of a 2018 CDC report, San Antonio is the 4th chunkiest city in the NBA with more than 37% of adults registering as “clinically obese”. And with over half of San Antonians identifying as female, it’s safe to say the city *does* have a lot of *Big ol Women™*.

Interesting side note: San Antonio isn’t just one of the fattest cities in the nation, they also have a distinct love for the rolls (pun intended). Per my research, San Antonio ranks #2 in the country for most google searches for “BBW”, which is of course the porn abbreviation for *Big Beautiful Women*. Not sure the significance of this fact, or how I came upon this information, but thought it was worth mentioning.

[google trend statistics for search term \\""bbw\\""](https://preview.redd.it/44t42v5dmwg41.png?width=466&format=png&auto=webp&s=5b9e965defdcc0bedd498dea3ee1369f16326141)

 *How many of these searches belong to Chuck himself? No small amount, I can assure you.*

 

**“Who’s Victoria?” — San Antonio**

Using [Victoria’s Secret store locator](https://www.victoriassecret.com/store-locator), I compiled the total number of store locations in each NBA city. Then, using 2016 U.S. Census Bureau statistics, I appended the populations for each city and calculated the amount of Victoria’s Secret stores per capita.

[ NBA cities ranked by Victoria's Secret stores per capita ](https://preview.redd.it/a8l2hdrgmwg41.png?width=658&format=png&auto=webp&s=97e81c43e0ac765ac3237f7df91ba0a1e2708772)

Again, Chuck’s intuition was spot-on! The city of San Antonio has the 4th fewest number of Victoria’s Secret stores per capita of all NBA cities (bottom 89th percentile).

I guess it’s safe to conclude, Victoria really is a secret in San Antonio.

*The author contacted Victoria’s Secret Public Relations prior to publishing this article but they chose not to comment on this story.*

 

**How do fried Spanish pastries play into this?**

Tremendously, that’s how.

I literally spent over three hours immersed in “churro data”. Admittedly, one of those hours was a lunchtime run to “Angel’s Churros & Chocolates” in Houston, TX — shout out to Maria for hooking it up with the Nutella on the side!

Using cutting-edge scientific research tools, I determined the number of churro vendors per capita in each NBA city. Okay, I googled that shit. I figured counting Mexican restaurants in general would be super misleading so I quantified specifically the number of churro vendors in each NBA city using the following criteria: Performed the google search “\[CITY\] Churros” (e.g., “San Antonio Churros”) and counted the amount of vendors with *explicit* references to “Churro” in the name. I accepted various spellings and puns (e.g., “xurros”, or “Churroholic”, etc).

[ NBA cities ranked by churro-vendors per capita ](https://preview.redd.it/9gjixg6kmwg41.png?width=580&format=png&auto=webp&s=e4fe6433feafdaa01a5a827a841ca236988cc978)

Well Mr. Barkley’s hunch was right again… San Antonio has the 4th most Churro-Vendors per capita in the NBA (top \~90th percentile). Have to admit, though, I did *not* expect to see Salt Lake City rank so high on this list. Considering the [strip club rankings](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/dt0ucg/i_analyzed_james_hardens_performance_in_every_nba/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x), I might actually have to make a trip to the ‘great white west’… 

&#x200B;

We have to give credit to Chuck here; he certainly knows his stuff! But for a man who [disavows data science](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZf9NFaCQHQ), it begs the question, how does he know so much about the Alamo city?

&#x200B;

# The Analysis

With my suspicions on the rise, I dug deeper into the data. And the more I dug, the more it smelled… \*sniff\* and I love the smell of cinnamon and projection in the morning. So what is Mr. Barkley hiding? Well, I analyzed his career performance in San Antonio to see if there is more to the story.

Charles Barkley has an [impressive resume](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Barkley): two-time Olympic gold medalist, 11-time NBA All Star, 1993 Most Valuable Player, and an esteemed member of the NBA hall of fame. He went by the intimidating moniker, *Round Mound of Rebound*. He is, indubitably, one of the greatest ballers of all time. But, just like all the greats, he had a weakness…

&#x200B;

**‘The Biggest Loser’**

Between the years 1983–1998, Barkley played 19 games in San Antonio. *He won just 4 of them*. With his career road-win percentage at nearly .500, and considering the other damning stats laid out below, his .211 win rate in San Antonio falls soundly in the ""*curious""* column.

* Career Road W/L Record: 259–276 (.484 win%)
* San Antonio W/L Record: 4–15 (.211 win%)

 

[ W\/L split, Career Away vs in San Antonio ](https://preview.redd.it/hiw4wzawmwg41.png?width=696&format=png&auto=webp&s=49520e597148522c9414d67508b7de45bb8d8eac)

Now I don’t want to mislead you, San Antonio were no schmucks during this period and, obviously, basketball is a team sport. But Barkley carries most of the water: he was a generational talent and the stand-out star on most of his teams (aside from a couple years with a washed up Julius Erving and an aging Moses Malone in Philly and a couple with near-retirement Hakeem in Houston). But the following analysis should help further make my case.

&#x200B;

**‘My -25% Life’**

San Antonio proved to be a blight on Barkley’s esteemed career. My analysis showed significant declines in almost every statistical category examined:

* **GmSc** — Averaged a **-25% variance** in Game Score in SA compared to career avg
* **ORB** — Averaged a -**11% variance** in Offensive Rebounds in SA as compared to career avg
* **FT%** — Averaged a **-9% variance** in FT shooting efficiency in SA as compared to career avg
* **FG%** — Averaged a **-2% variance** in shooting efficiency in SA as compared to career avg
* **AST** — Averaged a **-6% variance** in Assists in SA as compared to career avg

Note: [GmSc](https://www.basketball-reference.com/about/glossary.html) (Game Score) is a John Hollinger-created stat that gives a comprehensive measure of a player’s productivity. Formula: *GmSc=PTS+(0.4\*FG)–(0.7\*FGA)–\[0.4\*(FTA-FT)\]+(0.7\*ORB)+(0.3\*DRB)+STL+(0.7\*AST)+(0.7\*BLK)–(0.4\*PF)-TOV*

Here’s what the analysis looks like:

[ Barkley performance analysis via heat mapping ](https://preview.redd.it/bm4bja82nwg41.png?width=1127&format=png&auto=webp&s=e8908dd66fda7cb895c93a1f498644ed734988d1)

You can see the heat map to the left is covered in red. Red cells indicate *negative* variances, meaning: for that year, Barkley’s average in San Antonio was *below* his Season Average. Of the 112 total data points examined (8 stats x 14 seasons), Barkley under-performed against the season average **62%** of the time.

Heat maps are great but I needed to visualize the data in a way that better depicts the scale of Chuck’s drop in performance. I used a clustered column chart because it gives the best visual representation of relative performance, as you can easily identify the +/- trends (*Graphs for Dummies: larger/more frequent lines on BOTTOM = BAD; larger/more frequent lines on TOP = GOOD*). 

 

[Barkley GmSc Variance in SA vs Season Avg](https://preview.redd.it/d7u0gmi4nwg41.png?width=801&format=png&auto=webp&s=2060d12d0604f038bcbb8c7a135b5a0b22ff9816)

These huge performance declines are damning. But what do they truly *tell us*?

&#x200B;

#  Conclusion

Well, if you’ve been following along, things should be starting to make sense. A picture has formed… how could a man who so ardently rebukes data science, know things about San Antonio that only the *data* can tell us?

Every Great had their weakness. MJ couldn’t stop gambling. Shaq couldn’t hit free throws. Magic couldn’t keep it in his pants. Kobe never saw a shot he didn’t like. LeBron, hairline.

For Charles Barkley, it was an entire city. The plus-sized women of San Antonio and their delectable Spanish pastries were the Round Mound’s kryptonite. And it appears he never got over it. A career of indulgence in the Alamo City has left him bitter with regret.

The Chuckster has used his platform on TNT to — not very credibly — disguise his own predilections for the amenities of San Antonio. Without stretching the facts too far, we can paint a vivid picture of Barkley’s own struggle. Imagine: a perpetual Big-and-Tall man since roughly the age of 12 (guessing) and a basketball phenom would have become accustomed to night-after-night by himself with nothing but his appetite and a sense that — thanks to his coaches — he *deserved* to be rewarded. That he was a *good boy*. Another city, another game, another 4-star hotel room to himself (another sold-out show, as it were).

The excitement of seeing San Antonio on the schedule brings tears to the man’s eyes. He knows what awaits him and purposefully forgets what happened before…

>*Barkley, awaken by the morning sun’s blistering reflection off the San Antonio R̶i̶v̶e̶r̶* [*Creek*](https://www.mysanantonio.com/news/local/article/San-Antonio-River-Authority-fires-back-at-Charles-5465978.php)*, sees the debris and refuse from an all-night binge. He did it again. Churro wrappers crinkling beneath his weight, cinnamon sugar coating the corners of his mouth and fingers alike, and a familiar wave of anxiety that tends to come after relapse. As his memory from the prior night returns, he glances around the room with a vain hopefulness that he did not ‘fall’ alone. He was relieved to learn that, in fact, he was not alone in the previous night’s debasement. Positioned heavily — nay, crushingly — on the duvet is a Big ol Woman™ sporting a handsome pair of* [*bloomers*](https://www.ebay.com/itm/Lolita-Women-Sweet-Bloomers-Underwear-Pumpkin-Shorts-Safety-Pants-Cosplay-/182538951060)*. Her voluminous mass reassuring him — no, beckoning him — to forgive himself for his indiscretions. It wasn’t just him after all. But he knew exactly what he had done. In a rush to forget, he licked the crusted cinnamon from his lips, quietly donned his game day attire and snuck out to meet his teammates in the lobby.*  
>  
>  
*But his mind would never leave that hotel room.*

It is through painting this portrait of a man both conflicted and passionate (aren’t we all) that we can better understand the system of associations that have led Barkley to betray his own naked psychology for all the world to jeer at. And yet, can we blame the man? Are we not all, on some level, looking for someone to share in our appetites? Whether it be for the occasional night of plus-size women and churros, or too many designer handbags; everyone has a vice. Unfortunately, from years of shame for letting down his teammates and coaches, Chuck has betrayed the very thing that he loves. 

That’s why I’m here to tell him, myself: **Stop Projecting, Mr. Barkley.**

**In 2020, the decade of proclaimed** **ass-eating, there is** ***no*** **shame. It’s** ***okay*** **to stan for Big ol Women™. In fact, it’s** ***great.***

6cbgx1,Wilt Chamberlain secretly dominated professional basketball at age 16 under a false identity. Scoring as much as 46 points against pros in the Eastern U.S. with a team record of 36-1. By age 17 he was averaging 40.5ppg. This is the first time I'm sharing this research:,"[Wilt Chamberlain Dominating Professional basketball leagues at age 16, and 17](http://imgur.com/vNZZsm5)

Calculated averages for 17 year old Wilt as a Quakertown Fay:

* 40.5ppg in 9 regular season games (according to one of the articles)

* 74ppg in 6 playoff games (according to the math... not sure it's even possible but who knows)

* 53.9ppg in 15 total games (according to a Quakertown book)

* Worth mentioning he won the MVP award in that league

[Image 3](http://imgur.com/2nhBTqC.jpg)

[Image 4](http://i.imgur.com/BBnYsYc.jpg)

[Image 5](http://i.imgur.com/ecuUBnC.png)

Wilt Chamberlain, or as he was first known, ""George Marcus"", secretly dominated professional basketball under that assumed identity at age 16 for the Pittsburgh Raiders. Even as a kid against 6-11 men his own size playing professionally (such as former Harlem Globetrotters!) he averaged 53.9ppg by age 17. I found game recaps of multiple 46 point performances for the Quakertown Fay's at age 17, and at least one 44 point game even at age 16 for the Pittsburgh Raiders.

This is not only not often talked about, it's NEVER talked about. I've seen only a few references to his professional career that predated college basketball. When I researched this I found out it got him into potential trouble with the NCAA and so it was kept hushed and perhaps left to be forgotten.

*EDIT* Allow me to plug one other researcher who I've come to learn first shared the photographs of Wilt playing for the Fay's a few years ago. I found him on Twitter, and here's a link to a fascinating video he produced!

*EDIT*

IMPORTANT UPDATE - According to a Quakertown book (researched by [bardown](http://www.bardown.com/under-a-fake-identity-wilt-chamberlain-dominated-pro-basketball-when-he-was-16-and-17-1.757398) staff) Wilt actually averaged 53.9ppg in all 15 games as a Quakertown Fay! He ""only"" averaged 40.5ppg in 9 regular season games but with playoffs combined his 15 game average shoots up to 53.9ppg! This means 74ppg in the 6 playoff games as a Fay. I'm not sure if this is even possible so please take with a grain of salt. Though he did score 90 points in high school and 100 in the NBA including 5 other 70+ point games so who knows.

uoqvuf,A moment to acknowledge Bismack Biyombo,"I wanted to take a second to acknowledge Bismack Biyombo. Last night on the broadcast they said he was a free agent and signed with the Suns, which is technically very true but doesn’t tell the full story:

Biyombo stepped away from the game a couple of years ago to return to Africa and take care of his father, who got COVID. Biyombo flew him to Europe for treatment, but his father died. Biyombo was unable to find the will to return to the game and took a year off. 

He came back this year because he wanted to play with a purpose, that purpose ultimately being donating his entire Suns salary to build a hospital back home in his dad’s name.

It’s a pretty touching story that should be known by all fans.",30624,587,themariokarters,2022-05-13 12:43:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/uoqvuf/a_moment_to_acknowledge_bismack_biyombo/,0.96,False,False,False,False

g47zy8,Future HoF Vince Carter has played with or against nearly 40% of all players who have ever played in the HISTORY of the NBA.,"Of the 4509 players who have ever played in the NBA, Vince Carter has been teammates with or played against 1672 (37.081%) of them. 

Methodology:

* On a spreadsheet, I copied a list of every NBA player ever from [https://stats.nba.com/players/list/?Historic=Y](https://NBA.com). 
* I went box score by box score through games Vince Carter played and crossed off players names who played in the same game as him
* Something important to note is that if someone was on the bench but did not play, then it did not count. 
* I did this for all 1541 games in Vinsanity's 21 seasons.

Here's a spreadsheet for all the players Vince has NOT played against:

aie075,ESPN/ABC should take note of what Tony Romo did in the booth last night and replace Mark Jackson with someone who actually provides insight and perspective during a nationally televised NBA game.,"Last night Tony Romo added beautiful color commentary to the Chiefs/Patriots game last night. As a former Quarterback he provided great insight as to what play the other team may or may not run, and why. He even predicted quite a few plays. 

What we get for nationally televised NBA games during the Conference Finals and NBA finals from Mark Jackson is nothing short of crap. Jackson offers no insight as a former point guard. Instead he spends most of the game poking fun at JVG and talking about absolute nonsense and quite frankly I’m sick of it. He distracts the fans and ruins the experience, especially when it’s a game when there’s so much on the line.

qzngvj,How many dirty plays does Lebron need to be considered a dirty player?,"Fairly simple question. He’s starting to stack them up now, it’s not just the one from last night on Stewart.

https://gfycat.com/gifs/detail/MeaslyEnlightenedIrishsetter (multiple bron dirty plays, including tripping steph with his bad ankle injury history)

https://streamable.com/r8e0xl (bron pushes Livingston midair to land on the same knee where he tore his ACL, MCL, PCL, lateral meniscus, and dislocated his knee cap)

https://youtu.be/Qd7Rn5U4VzY (bron pushes Embiid midair to land on his back)

https://youtu.be/SV0PsMLonPc (bron slide tackles steph)(after reading comments this one admittedly isn’t dirty, but I do think it was a reckless play with how big he is)

Another thing, how many nutshots did Draymond have to be “the ball kicker”? Was it more than 3? Not sure, anyways here’s Bron doing a few of em.

https://streamable.com/re8j0 (bron knees steph in the balls)

https://streamable.com/lh45i (bron elbows Iggys balls)

https://gfycat.com/serenepowerlessilladopsis (bron kicks Iggys balls)

A lot of these are on guys who had a bad history with injuries. Lebron really needs to stop these antics or he’s going to seriously injure someone eventually.

o6erkw,"The Media Complaining about Uninteresting Contenders this Year is a their own Fault, they've been Lazy about Covering 90% of NBA for years","The NBA media focuses on like 4 teams and 10 players all year and then gets upset that those teams/players aren't going to be in the finals. They complain about the big teams/stars being out and say fans aren't going to watch because the relative unknowns are the only ones left

This only happens because NBA media sucks at covering their own sport. Speaking specifically about the Suns, the storylines are practically spoon-fed to them and all year all they've done is down-play and ignore rather than hype up.

They could've talked about the team going from 20 wins to 2nd best team in just 2 years. About Booker going from the bottom to the top, proving the doubters wrong, and trying to become legendary for Kobe. They could've focused Cam Payne going from out of the league to 6th man for a .700 team or hyped up how the bubble changed our culture.

They could've spoken about how James Jones came out of nowhere to become an excellent GM or how Monty is proving his old doubters wrong. They could've talked about Ayton's humility and huge improvement throughout the year or Bridges being a winning role player everywhere on the court

Instead of all that, they just talked about CP3 because that's all they knew. And rather than doubting a team for their improbable run, they could've hyped it up more. 

They just wanted to focus on big names and popular teams and were unprepared that others might have success so now a ton are either scrambling or complaining about the matchups and how ""they're bad for the NBA.""

Why does the NBA media do this? No other league does it. When KC and Mahomes came out of nowhere it was all about hyping them up, not downplaying or ignoring them

Such a large portion of NBA media just sucks at their job",28741,2860,iamadragan,2021-06-23 15:10:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/o6erkw/the_media_complaining_about_uninteresting/,0.91,False,True,False,False

Then he drops the not-so-subliminal bomb at Giannis saying he wishes he could just be 7 feet tall and run and dunk with no skill.  The cold war that has been simmering since last season between Harden and Giannis is officially a real thing now.

13potkg,"ESPN, if you’re reading this: please, we’re begging you, no more Mark Jackson next year","After watching ESPN’s coverage of the Western Conference Finals, I seriously don’t understand how Mark Jackson is the best that ESPN can do as far as in-game analysts go.

Jackson’s commentary is, at best, perfunctory.  He offers the same type of analysis as the [baseball scouts in Moneyball](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=DtumWOsgFXc&pp=ygUQTW9uZXliYWxsIHNjb3V0cw%3D%3D), just regurgitating platitudes about how so-and-so is a “winning player” or the “type of guy you want on your team.”  When he does go out on a limb and offer a real opinion, I find that the opinion he offers is usually stupid.  For example, in last night’s game, with Denver up two late, the Lakers had a side-out with 3.2 on the shot clock.  Jackson’s analysis?  “If you’re Denver, you want to make sure LeBron doesn’t get a step-back three.”  Motherfucker, that’s the exact shot Denver had been forcing LeBron to beat them with all series, and he was shooting it poorly all series.  Naturally, Denver, a team led by a man who has been able to retain his employment as an NBA coach, walled up inside and prevented them from getting an easy two to tie it up.  

Jackson also is one of those commentators who clearly comes in with an agenda of what he expects (some would say “wants”) to happen.  He clearly hadn’t prepared for the possibility of Denver dominating the series, and when they won last night he basically fell silent for the entire post-game show.  

Look at the comments in almost any ESPN-covered game on here, and you’ll find countless examples of fans complaining about the commentary and begging for more games to be on TNT to get a respite from Jackson. It seems like fans are pretty universally on board with wanting a change.  Jackson isn’t even a very big name like Reggie Miller or Grant Hill (both of whom are far better analysts than he is), so I don’t understand the appeal - I can’t imagine any casual fans are particularly curious what Mark Jackson’s thought are on a given game. 

That’s not even mentioning that he’s apparently [so bad at the non-commentary aspects of his job](http://amp.awfulannouncing.com/nba/after-mvp-voting-fiasco-is-mark-jackson-still-a-viable-head-coaching-candidate-in-the-nba.html) that he accidentally voted for what he thought was All-NBA twice instead of submitting his desired MVP ballot. 

AND, on top of all that, there’s Mark Jackson’s alleged [history of homophobia](https://www.knbr.com/2022/05/10/mark-jackson-reportedly-used-homophobic-slurs-said-rick-welts-and-jason-collins-were-going-to-hell-as-warriors-head-coach/).  Now, I know that corporate “allyship” is all fake and performative.  I also am not one of those people who thinks that mere allegations of bad behavior or beliefs should immediately get you fired from your job.  But when I’m watching the games and I know that the commentator is a probable homophobe ON TOP OF being terrible at his job, it makes it extra frustrating that they just keep bringing him back.

So, why does ESPN insist on keeping him on? He’s not that big of a name, has a dubious personal history, and - most importantly - he doesn’t produce a good end product.  

What is he offering that another commentator can’t?",28269,2214,HereToTalkMovies2,2023-05-23 13:38:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/13potkg/espn_if_youre_reading_this_please_were_begging/,0.92,False,False,False,False

8mzetu,Bad officiating calls in Warriors-Rockets G7,"Strap in boys, it's gonna be a ride. So I've basically reviewed the whole game last night, and here are the questionable plays which I thought should have been calls/were called wrongly.

#Calls going against Rockets:

1. [Wrong travelling call against Capela](https://streamable.com/cso98), didn't lift up his pivot foot.

2. [Slight push on PJ Tucker no call, KD gets the call on the other end](https://streamable.com/boqtv). Probably a superstar call.

3. [Harden might have gotten shoved in the back by Looney](https://streamable.com/7189z), no call.

4. [Capela called for a goaltend for what seemed to be a clean block](https://streamable.com/qtz8u).

5. [Harden fouled on the landing](https://streamable.com/4d9r6), no call. [Slowmo](https://streamable.com/s06jh)

6. [Harden fouled on three attempt](https://streamable.com/bzjys), no call. [Slowmo](https://streamable.com/alpcm)

7. [Ref disallows continuation on Harden's three](https://streamable.com/vhads). [Slowmo](https://streamable.com/lydp2)

8. [Eric Gordon fouled by Draymond](https://streamable.com/zynw6), no call.

#Calls going against Warriors:

1. [Klay gets called for an early 2nd foul which didn't look like much contact](https://streamable.com/e0s94), looked like ball just slipped out of EG's hands.

2. [Curry's hip gets pushed by Gerald Green](https://streamable.com/o4nk6), even falls on the ground. No call.

3. [Jordan Bell raked across the arm by Harden](https://streamable.com/s2n6m), no call. (pro tip: right click and select 1/4 speed to see the contact)

4. [Klay gets hand checked by Tucker and loses the ball](https://streamable.com/pqylu). No call. [Slowmo](https://streamable.com/j8f9c)

5. [KD gets pushed into Harden by Ryan Anderson](https://streamable.com/n27zm), foul on KD. Similar to [this play](https://streamable.com/nhcep), albeit less egregious by Anderson.

6. [Klay gets a point removed by Scott Foster](https://streamable.com/0nhtk).

A major theme which showed itself was the fact that Ryan Anderson literally (I'm not kidding) hand checked Curry every time he was switched onto him. And the Warriors forced that switch A LOT. Here's ALL the plays where Anderson guarded Curry:

t2qgqq,The final 21 seconds of last night’s Nets/Bucks game took more than 17 minutes of real time to play out and is everything wrong with NBA crunch time basketball these days.,"After two clutch and exciting blocks by the Nets to keep their lead, Andre Drummond grabbed the rebound and was fouled with 21.7 seconds remaining. After that, there were 2 timeouts, 33 substitutions, 8 fouls, 19 free throw attempts and just one field goal attempt, all over the course of more than 17 minutes of real time. This cannot continue to happen in today’s game, and just is an embarrassing way to end what was a very entertaining game up to that point. I don’t blame the head coaches one bit for using the rules to their advantage, which is why the rules need to change as soon as possible.

o427ei,"15 years ago, Giannis was homeless in Greece, was in constant fear of deportation and racist retaliation, and didn’t play basketball. Against all odds, Giannis has already carved out a better life for his family. Now, after scoring 40 points in game 7, he has a chance at basketball immortality","Giannis is the son of Nigerian immigrants that came to Greece in search of a better life. In reality, their life would be exceedingly difficult; they were homeless, they struggled to find work, and they were constantly in fear of deportation as they were unable to acquire full Greek citizenship. They had four children to feed, and often there was not enough to go around. In the worst of times, Giannis and his family would go two or three days without eating.

At 13, Giannis, rail-thin and with no basketball experience, was discovered by a (previously) failed basketball scout. After the scout promised to secure Giannis’ parents with employment, Giannis began playing for a local club and improving his skills. 

Even in this time, Giannis’ family did not have resources, and it was people like cafe owner Giannis Tzikas, who used to give the family sandwiches for free, that kept them afloat. In the words of Tzikas, some people asked, “why are you feeding the black kids”, but this only made him more determined to help. 

By 2012, Giannis had somehow managed to become an exciting prospect in Greece’s basketball second division, which initially was too obscure of a location to be noticed by many NBA scouts. However, he was noticed by Basket Zaragoza in Spain, who offered him 400,000 euros a year to play for them. Giannis was indescribably excited, saying “I’ll bring my family along with me and I’ll buy a car”.

Shortly afterwards, Giannis began to be hyped up by NBA scouts; he was the 2013 draft’s most exciting unknown. With the 15th pick, the Bucks took a chance on him, and the rest is history. 

In Giannis’ rookie season, then teammate Brandon Knight described Giannis regularly carrying six or seven boxes of free food home from the players lounge. When Caron Butler casually threw away a pair of shoes, Giannis, who had grown up sharing one pair with now teammate Thanasis, pulled them out of the garbage, shocked that someone would just throw away such good shoes. 

Even now, after signing the biggest contract in league history, Giannis has not forgotten his roots. He regularly gives his money and his time to help people in Milwaukee and in Greece, and has never forgotten to give back in spreading kindness and joy. 

Winning a championship in a market that doesn’t attract superstars is a difficult feat, but Giannis’ story shows that he has already done the hard part. Back in 2014, the fresh-faced, 195 pound, 19-year-old Giannis was asked, “So you got a job, a place to live, what’s next”? Giannis responded, somewhat jokingly, “Nothing. Just win a ring now”. After accomplishing everything else, this year might just be his chance.",26030,1483,bonziwellsayo,2021-06-20 09:54:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/o427ei/15_years_ago_giannis_was_homeless_in_greece_was/,0.91,False,True,False,False

You’re just hiding it. And you all are married while you’re doing it. I’m divorced. I’m retired. I’m having fun.”","[Source](https://www.si.com/nba/2021/09/07/paul-pierce-celtics-hall-of-fame-daily-cover)

>Let’s start here: Paul Pierce isn’t sorry.

>Not for the video, that minutes-long clip that made the rounds on social media, the one that cost Pierce his job at ESPN. Honestly, Pierce didn’t even know he made a video. Here’s what happened: In April, Pierce was playing poker at a friend’s house in Los Angeles. There was drinking. And smoking. And strippers. And after a little too much drinking and smoking, Pierce decided to start an Instagram Live and, well, show off the strippers. He went on for a few minutes, riffing, he thought, for a couple hundred people. When he finished, he deleted it. **He didn’t know IG Lives can be recorded (they can) and reposted (it was). Pierce went home that night thinking no one noticed. He woke up the next day and discovered everyone had.**

>Still . . . sorry? “For what?” asks Pierce. It’s early July, and Pierce is reclining in a straight-backed chair at The Spot, a hookah lounge tucked into a strip mall in Encino, Calif. Around him, clusters of 20- and 30-somethings, many on laptops huddled over glowing screens, oblivious to the presence of basketball royalty. Hours earlier, Pierce was at home, a tailor dispatched by the Basketball Hall of Fame taking measurements for a suit to fit Pierce’s 6’7” frame. “I haven’t bought a new suit since I retired,” says Pierce. But he needed something to wear in September for his enshrinement in Springfield, Mass., 90 miles from where he spent the bulk of his 19-year NBA career.

&nbsp;

>ESPN didn’t ask for an apology. The relationship between Pierce and the network had become strained over the past two years. Pierce hated the travel. Network executives didn’t think he was working hard enough. The video, industry sources told Sports Illustrated, was the last straw. “I was done with them, anyway,” says Pierce between pulls of lemon mint. **“It wasn’t a great fit. There’s a lot of stuff over there that you can’t say. And you have to talk about LeBron all the time.”**

>Pierce’s longtime agent, Jeff Schwartz, suggested Pierce apologize anyway. Schwartz worried that the video might influence Hall voters. Pierce didn’t. “Come on, I didn’t do anything illegal,” says Pierce. “These motherf-----s in the Hall of Fame, some did [cocaine], f---ing battery. What the f--- did I do? I was just having a good time. All the people coming after me, half you motherf-----s do the same s---. You’re just hiding it. And you all are married while you’re doing it. I’m divorced. I’m retired. I’m having fun.” And if Hall voters had held it against him? “Listen,” says Pierce, “if I didn’t make it with this class, it would be the biggest stiff job in Hall of Fame history.”

>Schwartz suggested Pierce speak to Jerry Colangelo, the longtime NBA and USA Basketball exec who doubled as Hall chairman. Pierce agreed. In May, Pierce was in Springfield for former teammate Kevin Garnett’s induction. At a dinner, he approached Colangelo. Pierce repeated: He didn’t think he did anything wrong. “What happened has nothing to do with what I did on the court,” says Pierce.


&nbsp;

>Pierce has ideas. He’s collaborating with Garnett on a few. The two are planning on launching a podcast. Pierce wants to do a show that follows the two of them traveling the world. “Just doing all the s--- we couldn’t do when we played,” says Pierce. For example? “Skydiving,” says Pierce. “Maybe a bull run in Spain. Get motorcycles and travel around. Experience different cultures, different foods. That would be so much fun.”

4e8ikq,How my NBA experience turned into a nightmare thanks to StubHub - They denied my chance to see the final ever game at Sleep Train Arena last night by selling me invalid tickets.,"**4/11 - Here is an update since I don't think it is right to not give StubHub the positive publicity as well when they have reached out and offered to make it up to me.**
___________________________________

StubHub has reached out to me and advised me that, in keeping with their Buyer Guarantee of offering equal or better seats, they will get me tickets to the home opener next year.

The rep was extremely professional and apologetic for the situation. I told him they really should provide some kind of safeguards for buyers. He assured me that they aggressively go after any sellers who break their rules.
I'd have rather got in to the final game, but I am happy with the outcome.
__________________________________



**TL:DR – StubHub sold my wife and I invalid tickets to the final game ever at Sleep Train Arena (ARCO Arena) – they did not notify me the tickets were bad, I found out when we got denied by the scanner at the door.  Then they kept me on hold for over 40 minutes outside the venue.  I missed the game and it could happen to you.**
_______________

Let me preface this by saying I do not blame the Kings or NBA for this situation, however I do think that they need to be aware of what one of their major resellers is doing to their fans.

I am a Sacramento Kings fan - through thick and thin.  I scream about hating them, complain, and bemoan our lack of defense, lack of wins, lack of… everything.  We don’t have much.  We haven’t been to the playoffs in 10 years – the second longest drought in the NBA (behind the Wolves who I guarantee break that streak soon).  We have a superstar who teases us with his brilliance and then punishes us with his attitude and demeanor.  We went through an absolute nightmare of an ownership that tried not once, not twice, but three times to steal our team and take them to another city.  We just celebrated breaking thirty wins for the first time in nine years.  Yet I love the team to the core.

I’ve watched this team since I was a kid.  In the fourth grade, I had a Kings ruler with pictures of Danny Ainge, Wayman Tisdale, and Kenny Smith.  I had, and still have, only seen NBA games in a structure that has all of the sex appeal of a giant flat office building – Sleep Train Arena (it will always be ARCO to me).  

The entire basketball nation probably knows the plight of our dilapidated arena – tarps falling from the ceiling, leaks when it rains, toilets that don’t work.  Yet we Kings fans love the place.  We always have.  It’s the only real arena we have ever had – we don’t have any other major league sports in our city and this place is just cozy and fits us.  

It is the perfect arena for a bunch of rabid fans in a city that Phil Jackson infamously called a “cow town” – unwittingly unleashing the birth of the very loud Kings cowbells.

After all of the disasters of the previous ownership group, we finally were blessed by a man willing to save our team – Vivek Ranadive.  While we can argue his basketball knowledge and his hands on approach to basketball operations, we cannot argue that he saved the Sacramento Kings and ponied up a lot of money to build us a brand new arena in downtown Sacramento.

With that very arena scheduled to open this October, many of us Kings fans circled April 9, 2016 on our calendar; the final game at the “old barn” after 28 years.

I was one of those people.  I frequently purchase my tickets from a variety of sources – Kings.com, eBay, StubHub, Craigslist, etc.  Where ever the best deal lies.  Some are obviously more risky than others – Craigslist comes to mind.  

I would not fret about buying tickets from StubHub – I’ve done it before plenty of times.  I hear their commercials all of the time on the radio.  I had no reason to believe that there was any risk buying tickets from their website.

Unfortunately, I found out that I was completely wrong last night.
 
Yesterday, I bought tickets to the final game at Sleep Train with a scheduled tip off against the OKC Thunder at 7:30 pm.  I looked through StubHub and found a great dead for two tickets for my wife and I in Row H of the lower bowl.  The total price was $356.00 – expensive for a meaningless basketball game, but not for a once-in-a-lifetime event.  

The Kings were going to do it up big; tons of free giveaways, meet and greets with former players that spanned the entire Sacramento era, the opportunity to go out on the court and shoot a free throw and take pictures – it was going to be an amazing close to our shabby, but loved, arena.

I [purchased the tickets a little after 5:00 pm yesterday from StubHub](https://imgur.com/COW0Khe).  At 5:22 pm, I received my email confirmation with the tickets.  I immediately took [screenshots](http://imgur.com/22fIc9n) of [both tickets](https://imgur.com/gvpW9B0) to scan at the door on my phone.  My wife and I got ready and we were on our way to drive the 30 or so miles to the arena.

We arrived at approximately 7:00 pm and by this point could see all of the news trucks, concession stands, and hear the music playing.  We were getting excited.  The parking lot was as full as I’ve ever seen it.

We made our way past the security check point and walked up to the self-scanner at the door where I pulled up the screenshots of my tickets.  I scanned the first one at the turnstyle:  REFUND flashed on the screen.  I stood there for a second thinking maybe it didn’t register so I tried again.  REFUND.

At this point, people were piling up behind me so I stepped aside feeling a little embarrassed – like I was some scammer or didn’t know how to use the scanner.  This was where I felt my first pang of panic.  

I pulled up the second ticket and slid back in line to try again.  REFUND.  I flagged down a door attendant who tried his hand scanner on both tickets: REFUND, REFUND.  It was 7:05 pm and I was in full on panic mode now.  

The door attendant advised me to go to the box office so we tore off in that direction. I desperately did not want to miss the last ever player introductions at this arena.  Inside the box office, I was sympathetically told by the attendant, “I’m so sorry, this is a StubHub problem and we can’t help you – you need to call them but they’re very good at refunds.”

REFUND.  There’s that word again.  

I don’t want a refund – I want to see this game!  And time is tick, tick, ticking away.  I grab my phone and literally type StubHub into google as fast as my fingers will let me.  I find the number and call.  After the automated message, the voice tells me the first thing I was dreading to hear, “all of our representatives are assisting other callers – we will be with you shortly.”

I am basically beside myself by now – I am down to about 15 minutes to tip off and I have no way through the door.  At 7:25pm, while still on hold, I got desperate and went back to the box office.  I asked the representative what the cheapest tickets were just to get in the building.  He tells me $160.00 each for nosebleed upper bowl tickets – plus fees.  

I can’t believe what I am hearing.  I still don’t know the status of my StubHub tickets so now I am faced with the choice of buying these tickets in front of me for more than the lower bowl tickets that I should already have in my possession or continuing to wait on hold.

I don’t know if I am getting a refund or not for the StubHub tickets, since no one will answer the phone, and am afraid of buying four tickets.  The box office rep says to me, “man, I’m so sorry – we’ve been seeing this all night from StubHub.”

7:25 pm, 7:30 pm, 7:40 pm, 7:45 pm

By 7:45 pm, I came to the realization that I was not going to see this game.  My wife and I started the most depressing, dejected walk back to our car imaginable.  About halfway there, the StubHub rep finally came on the line – after 40+ minutes on hold.  I calmly (as possible) explained my situation to him and asked him exactly what had happened.

He was unable to explain why my tickets would not work.  I asked him point blank, “Did the guy who sold me these tickets also sell them to someone else.”  He would not answer, just saying that sometimes there are issues with the tickets.  I kept pressing him, asking him why I was not notified that my tickets would not work before I got to the door.  At least then I would have had an opportunity to get different ones.  [The only email I received at that point was my confirmation](https://imgur.com/si3xBbk).  He told me that they do not monitor the transactions so if there is an issue, you will not know until you get denied at the door.

I couldn’t believe that I was not getting an answer as to why my tickets would not work.  I explained to him that this was not just any game – this is a one-time event.  I could tell that he was starting to understand the gravity of my situation.  I kept pushing him about the seller and how this happened.  That’s when he dropped the bomb on me.

He said, and I quote, **“I probably shouldn’t tell you this, but the seller you bought these tickets from is already under investigation for selling bad tickets.”**

So there it is – StubHub knew that this guy is selling bad tickets on their site.  Or at the very least, he is selling the same tickets to multiple people.  The rep told me that he would be investigated which mean absolutely nothing to me standing in the parking lot.  

He told me he would issue a refund for the price of the tickets and offered me 20% off of my next purchase.  It wasn’t then, and it’s not now, about the money.  We missed something that we had our heart set on.

We went to a nearby restaurant and watched the game on TV which honestly felt more painful.  It was basically everything we knew it would be; a great halftime show featuring the past players, sentimental videos, the roar of the sell-out crowd as the game came down to the final shot – with the Kings winning it with 1 second on the clock.  But it wasn’t about the game on the court, it was about the atmosphere in the building.  And we missed it.

The final kick in the teeth came on the drive home as I listened to the post-game on AM radio.  During a commercial break there was a StubHub ad talking about their “guarantee” to get you in the game.  I couldn’t believe it.  

As soon as I got home, I fired off an email to StubHub explaining what happened [PART 1](https://imgur.com/CsPS7id) and [PART 2](https://imgur.com/xhxoupa).  This morning, [I got the response which was basically a form letter](https://imgur.com/05E42wK) with some things changed in it.  They ask me to call them back so that they can further investigate.  I called them and the rep I spoke to had no idea why I was calling in, saying, “oh they already are looking into the seller.  They probably just wanted you to call to verify you received your refund.”  I knew I got my refund last night!  

I asked him if he at least saw the 20% discount on my account for my next purchase and he said, “No I don’t see it but I will make sure I add it right now.  It’s actually a 20% credit based on the purchase price of the tickets you already bought.”  At this point, whatever.  So he tells me based on the price of $356.00, my credit on my account will be $71.20.  Not nearly what I think I should get for what I missed but I know I’m not going to get anywhere with this guy.  He thanks me for using StubHub (!) and the call ends.

A couple of minutes later, [an email comes through showing the credit issued to my account](https://imgur.com/Wjryil1).  $17.80.  Only missed the mark by $53.   At this point, I am at a loss for words.  

I have sent off yet another email re-explaining everything and asking the questions:

* Why does the seller retain control over tickets that he sold and [received money for](https://imgur.com/AlpkvTh)?

* Why does StubHub not warn it’s buyers that you will not make it in to your event if the seller chooses to take his tickets back and resell them to someone else?

* Why was I never advised before I made it to the gate that I was not going to get in?  Had I been advised with enough time, I could have received my refund and still bought other tickets.  By the time I found out I wasn’t getting in and then waited on hold for 40 minutes, I missed my chance to get in.

- Why was the offer of equal or better seats never given to me at the time?  I would have been mad at missing the first quarter, but at least I would have seen the final three quarters.

* Why is there not some sort of seller feedback system to warn buyers of fraudulent sellers similar to eBay?  By their own representative’s admission, this seller was known to StubHub to be a potentially fraudulent seller.  Had I known this guy had issues, I obviously would have avoided the listing.

Here is StubHub’s guarantee [straight from their website](http://www.stubhub.com/fanprotect-update/):

**Summary of StubHub guarantee to Buyers:**

* *You will get your tickets in time for the event*

* *Your tickets will be valid for entry*

* *Your tickets will be the same as those you ordered*

*If any of these things do not occur and you comply with applicable policies and timelines, we will find you comparable or better tickets to the event, or offer you a refund or FanCode for future purchase*


I was never, at any point last night, offered comparable or better tickets.  Even though at that point, I would have been mad as I had already missed the first quarter.


I apologize for the exceptionally long post.  I want to warn people about StubHub and tell everyone that this company is no better than buying from some stranger on Craigslist.  I hope this gains some traction so that no one else has to go through something as bad as this.",24920,1345,rattlemebones,2016-04-11 01:01:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4e8ikq/how_my_nba_experience_turned_into_a_nightmare/,0.88,False,True,False,False

yl90o9,"Kareem's take on Kyrie: ""Honestly, there’s little hope that he will change because he’s insulated by fame and money and surrounded by yes-people. There is no motivation to learn how to distinguish propaganda from facts. All that’s left is for the world to decide how it should respond to him.""",">My Take: I couldn’t be prouder of Shaq, Charles, and Reggie for their bold and straightforward comments. They are at the forefront of Black athletes that are condemning the recent antisemitic social media posts by Kyrie Irving and Ye (Kanye West). It’s a genuine “I am Spartacus” moment.

>The NBA Players Association also released a statement on Nov. 1: “Anti-Semitism has no place in our society. The NBPA is focused on creating an environment where everyone is accepted. We are committed to helping players fully understand that certain words can lead to hateful ideologies being spread We will continue to work on identifying and combatting all hate speech wherever it arises.”

>Yet, Irving has been defiant about his postings. You can read his long, rambling, at times contradictory defense here. Mostly he reveals his lack of awareness of how history works. It’s not an all-you-can-eat buffet from which you can pluck just the dishes you like without any understanding of the context.

>His inability to understand why his posts are news can be seen in this statement: “There’s things being posted every day. I’m no different from the next human being, so don’t treat me any different. You guys come in here and make up this powerful influence that I have (and say) you cannot post that. Why not? Why not?” If he really thinks someone with millions of followers spouting hate speech is the same as Jim in accounting posting on Facebook, then he really is out of step with reality.

>The Nets finally forced Irving to acknowledge the damage he’s done and donate $500,000 to groups opposing hate speech. In his statement you can almost hear his arm being twisted: “I oppose all forms of hatred and oppression and stand strong with communities that are marginalized and impacted every day. I am aware of the negative impact of my post towards the Jewish community and I take responsibility."" But there was no explicit apology—which tells us everything about what he really believes.

>Honestly, there’s little hope that he will change because he’s insulated by fame and money and surrounded by yes-people. There is no motivation to learn how to distinguish propaganda from facts. All that’s left is for the world to decide how it should respond to him.

>Kareem Note: The problem of antisemitism is much bigger than Irving or Ye. They are merely the unwitting spokesperson for the right-wing political movement that is blatantly taking over the GOP. (For the full story, read “Jewish leaders call on GOP candidates to reject antisemitic comments”). Many Republican candidates running for some of the most powerful positions in their states and in the country—such as Pennsylvania’s GOP gubernatorial nominee Doug Mastriano—feel perfectly free to publicly spout antisemitic statements without fear of reprisal from their own party or the voters. That should be a very troubling sign for all marginalized groups because fascists always start by demonizing one group—right before they go after the others.

I won’t allow the people around him to continue to silence me and continue to lie to protect this person. It’s unethical, it’s immoral, it’s truly SICK. It hurts my heart because I’ve always had hope, and so much love and as scary as this is for me to do it’s time I stand up for myself. I won’t be silent to protect others anymore because I value myself and my kids more than anyones ‘image’.… a fracture nose, wrist, torn eardrum, torn muscles in my neck from being choked until i went to sleep and a severe concussion. I don’t need sympathy, I just don’t want this happening to anyone else, I just want this person to get help, my kids deserve better. That’s all i want. It hurts, everything hurts, this situation hurts, most importantly I’m scared and hurting for my kids who were witness to everything. Please respect my families privacy and stop with the disgusting rumors and allegations”

As I've said in comments I never meant any disrespect to Clippers fans and congrats to them! When they were brought up I really didn't know how to do a 3 way deal between 2 cities. Now that here here though...

The spirit of the wager was the winning team donates to the other teams kids hospital. Clippes fans have wanted to be in this so much I'm hoping now they step up. I'd suggest donating to either city's kids hospital. You want to keep your donation local give to CHLA, want to show Toronto some love give to Sick Kids in Toronto. for Lakes and Raptors fans I'm suggesting they each give to the other charity. As a Raptors fan I'm still going to give to CHLA. There is no reason not to in my mind.

I'm glad my post could bring people together in a positive way and I know some good has come out of it.

cecxoc,People don't talk enough about how awful the Hornets are,"* One of only 6 teams in the NBA/NFL/MLB/NHL that's never even made a conference finals. They're the second oldest of those 6 teams behind the Clippers.

* They've only drafted 4 All-Stars that went on to play for them despite being around since 1988: Alonzo Mourning, Larry Johnson, Baron Davis, and Kemba Walker. And they've had the most chances to draft All-Stars too: the Hornets rank #1 with the lowest average draft spot in that time.

* Then-coach Steve Clifford wanted the Hornets to draft Donovan Mitchell in 2017, but Rich Cho overruled him and drafted Malik Monk instead.

* The Hornets were seriously looking to draft Pascal Siakam in 2016, but decided to trade their pick for Marco Belinelli who spent one year with the team before being traded to Atlanta in the Dwight Howard trade.

* The Hornets were offered three first-round picks by the Celtics for the #9 pick in 2015. Michael Jordan turned the offer down to pick Frank Kaminsky. Kaminsky was always in the coach's doghouse here, his family hated Charlotte, and Kaminsky signed with Phoenix this offseason.

* After having the worst record in NBA history in 2012, the Bobcats lost out on the #1 pick which was going to be Anthony Davis. They then selected Michael Kidd-Gilchrist with the #2 pick instead of Bradley Beal. In the same draft, they selected Jeffery Taylor with their 2nd round pick, just ahead of Draymond Green and Khris Middleton.

* They did select Kemba Walker in 2011, but they also gave Stephen Jackson, Shaun Livingston, and the pick that would turn into Tobias Harris so they could jump up and draft Bismack Biyombo. They selected Biyombo instead of the player that had been mocked to them in several mock drafts: Kawhi Leonard. They also had Klay Thompson on the board.

* The second best draft pick they've had since their 2004 rebirth has been Emeka Okafor.

* They haven't won a playoff series since April 2002 when LeBron was in high school, Zion was 1 year old, The Scorpion King was #1 at the box office, Ashanti had the #1 song in America, and Hollywood Hogan was WWE Champion. The closest they've come to winning a series since then was the Purple Shirt Guy game when they were up 3-2 vs. the Heat and had cut a 9 point Heat lead to 2 with 1:30 left. A Hornets fan known as Purple Shirt Guy started inexplicably jawing with Dwyane Wade who proceeded to drop a quick 5 points to tie the series up. The Hornets would go on to lose Game 7 in Miami by 27 points.

* Despite letting their best player ever walk for nothing, they're hard-capped at the moment. They'll be hard-capped this season with a starting 5 of Terry Rozier, Cody Zeller, Nic Batum, Dwayne Bacon, and Miles Bridges. Bismack Biyombo will be making $17 million off the bench, Marvin Williams will be making $15 million off the bench, and Michael Kidd-Gilchrist will be making $13 million off the bench. Nic Batum (who has turned into a completely worthless player) will be entering the 4th year of a 5 year deal (final year a player option) that will pay him $25.5 million. He'll almost certainly use that player option in 2020 and will be making $27.1 million.

* The Hornets hired a new radio play-by-play guy before the start of the 2018-19 season that grew up a Hornets fan and was a beloved radio host in Charlotte. He was fired in the middle of a week in March with no explanation and no explanation has come out since.

* Michael Jordan hasn't given an interview where he's discussed the Hornets in any detail (besides Kemba Walker) since 2014.

bowigy,Rachel Nichols and the ESPN crew were extremely disrespectful last night,"I’m not sure if this has been posted by someone already, but I just wanted to say that the things they let Rachel Nichols and Woj say during the draft lottery were blatantly disrespectful to all of the teams, save for maybe the Knicks, to all of the other draft picks, and to the Pelicans. Not to mention the fact that everything they were saying was being blasted throughout the entire venue. 

First off, there were over a dozen teams in attendance last night. The only one that they chose to talk about: the Knicks. They talked unbelievably liberally about Zion going to NY, as if they had already won it. However, as I doubt any of them realized, the Knicks had the same chance of obtaining the #1 pick as the Cavs and the Suns, the latter of which I don’t even think was mentioned once on the broadcast.

Then, there was Zion. Rachel Nichols kept referring to the #1 pick as “who gets Zion.” Every time she said that or mentioned the kid, the camera would cut to the embarrassed 18 y/o who was just there to see what team picks where. There is no guarantee that Zion will go #1 overall. It is very very likely, but not guaranteed. Not to mention that they did this in front of a large number of draft prospects in attendance. What does all of this coverage and press mean to them if it’s only going to Zion?

And finally, the Pelicans. Woj made every team’s case for a possible AD trade that night. Whenever a team with chances of getting a top 10 pick was mentioned, Woj had to slip in that they may be looking to use that pick as an “asset” to trade for AD. I’m honestly very happy the Pelicans won because the disrespect they were receiving the whole night was greatly trumped when they won the first pick.

Now I get all of these things are said ten times over on any other sports news broadcast. However, as I said, Rachel Nichols audio was blasted for everyone at the event to hear, including the draft prospects and team representatives. After watching this, I asked my dad if there was ever a time where the media would be able to speak this liberally about sports in front of all of those people. He said “no.”

Some other relevant quotes:

> For Curry, a typical offseason workout looks something like this: Sporting a hilarious golfer's tan and usually some kind of colorful, prototype Under Armour sneaker, Curry flies through a nearly impossible, full-court version of the conventional star shooting drill. Designed by Payne, it consists of 10 shots -- from the corner, baseline and wing -- with full-court 94-foot sprints in between. And it must be done with a minimum 80% accuracy and in under 56 seconds or the drill repeats. Essentially it's the same drill run in nearly every basketball practice on earth, turbocharged to an absurd degree for Curry, whose year-round conditioning goal is to always be ready to take the floor within two weeks.

 > Last offseason, when Curry did this workout at Stanford, several Division I players in attendance begged to join in on Payne's ultimate scoring-without-the-ball drill -- they all either collapsed from exhaustion or gave up halfway through. That's exactly what Payne expects, though, since the drill is designed specifically to challenge Curry's remarkable conditioning and unique skill set in order to prepare him for challenges like the one against Portland.

> ""Steph's definition of conditioning is different than most,"" Payne says. ""Lots of guys are in great shape. Can you be in the kind of great shape where you are fatigued after a long play like this and your quads are burning and you can't breathe but you can still maintain perfect mechanics and still make good decisions? Are you fatigued but can still execute at the highest levels?

8k8wej,Why LeBron would sign with every NBA team,"**Atlanta Hawks**

LeBron is secretly a huge Twister fan. He will join the Hawks so he can film Twister 2 with their owner’s wife on their off days.

**Boston Celtics**

LeBron misses Kyrie. He wants to play basketball with his friend and that means playing for the Celtics.

OR

LeBron wants to troll Kyrie. He will go to Boston management and ask them to trade Kyrie back to Cleveland if they want him to join. Danny Ainge will agree because he has no heart.

**Brooklyn Nets**

LeBron loves NY. He will go to New York to sign with the Knicks to play in historic Madison Square Garden. However, during the drive to the stadium, his driver makes a wrong turn and they end up in Brooklyn. LeBron realizes the mistake, but shrugs his shoulders and signs with the Nets instead, because he will have the same results with either the Knicks or Nets.


**Charlotte Hornets**

LeBron wants to prove he’s better than Michael Jordan. He will sign with the Hornets to taunt MJ directly. He will win the Finals in 2019 with the Hornets and won’t let MJ touch the trophy. After the season, LeBron will buy out MJ’s shares and he will become majority owner. He will then trade himself to a better team because Dwight is too annoying and nobody will agree to LeBron’s trade proposals involving Dwight.

**Chicago Bulls**

LeBron wants to prove he’s better than Michael Jordan. He will sign with the Bulls so he can win 7 championships to pass what MJ did.


**Cleveland Cavaliers**

LeBron loves Cleveland as much as he hates moving. LeBron will re-sign with the Cavs, because it’s more convenient than moving to a different city.

**Dallas Mavericks**

LeBron is still haunted by the 2011 Finals. He will go to Dallas to learn from the true GOAT Dirk Nowitzki. There, LeBron will lead the Mavs all the way to the number 1 seed in the West, only to lose to the Warriors in the first round after KD leaves for India to re-join his snek charmer friend.

**Denver Nuggets**

LeBron loves chicken nuggets. He will sign with Denver, only to be disappointed. He then will retire and start his own chicken nugget company.

**Detroit Pistons**

LeBron will become the new Pistons President of Basketball Operations. His first act in his new role will be to sign himself as the head coach/starting SF. His second transaction will be to trade Blake Griffin to the Cavs for the 8th pick in the draft and salary filler, because LeBron will blackmail Dan Gilbert into doing it.

**Golden State Warriors**

LeBron wants all the ringz. He will sign with the Warriors for the veteran minimum so he can win not 1, not 2, not 3, not 4, not 5, not 6, not 7, not 8, not 9, but 10 championships.

**Houston Rockets**

LeBron loves space. He will sign with the Rockets so he can go to NASA and fly an actual rocket into space to find better competition on other planets. Mike Dan Tony will be confused why LeBron doesn’t show up to their games. Mike, he’s in space, deal with it.

**Indiana Pacers**

LeBron loves pace. He will sign with the Pacers so he can out-pace the other NBA players and win a championship. He will also become best friends with Lance Stephenson and the two will call out plays to each other by blowing in each other’s rear, I mean ear.

**LA Clippers**

LeBron wants to live in Hollywood, but doesn’t want to be under the shadow of Laker greats. If he can just lead the Clippers to the conference finals, they would rename their franchise LeBron’s Clippers.

**LA Lakers**

LeBron wants to live in Hollywood, but doesn’t want to be under the shadow of Clipper goods. He also wants to learn from the great Lavar Ball on how to play basketball as good as him.

**Memphis Grizzlies**

LeBron will not sign with the Memphis Grizzlies.

**Miami Heat**

LeBron will go back to Miami because he left his white headband there and wants it back.

**Milwaukee Bucks**

LeBron loves freaks. He will join the Greek Freak and sign with the Bucks. Then they will sign Rick James to preform every halftime so he can sing LeBron’s favorite song “Super Freak”

**Minnesota Timberwolves**

LeBron wants to learn from former MVP Derrick Rose. He also wants to torture his body and allow Coach Thibs to play him all 48 minutes for all 82 games.

**New Orleans Pelicans**

LeBron loves smoothies. He will join the Brow and sign with the Pelicans, so he can get unlimited smoothies at the Smoothie King Center.

**New York Knicks**

LeBron loves NY. He will go to New York to sign with the Knicks to play in historic Madison Square Garden. During the drive to the stadium, his driver makes the correct turn and they end up in MSG. LeBron realizes this and signs with the Knicks.

**OKC Thunder**

LeBron will sign with the Thunder so he can play with Russell Westbrook for one season, then leave after that and become an even better player.

**Orlando Magic**

LeBron will take his talents to Central Florida. He will sign with the Magic and lead them to another Finals lost.

**Philadelphia 76ers**

LeBron will sign with the 76ers because he trusts the process. LeBron will single handedly play bad for 3 seasons and tank so that the 76ers will get more draft picks to add to their squad. Then by age 37, LeBron will have what he needs to win another Eastern Conference Finals.

**Phoenix Suns**

LeBron loves hot-related teams. He will sign with the Suns and win 2 championships to prove to Pat Riley that he isn’t so special with his so called “Heat” for the “Suns” are the hottest thing in the universe.

**Portland Trail Blazers**

LeBron loves Nike. He will sign with the Blazers so that he can spend his off days at Nike headquarters creating new shoes.

**Sacramento Kings**

LeBron is the King. He will sign with the Kings, because that’s where he belongs.

**San Antonio Spurs**

LeBron loves Coach Pop. He will sign with the Spurs to learn from him, only to find out Coach Pop actually has no idea what he’s doing and is just really lucky. LeBron will use that luck to convince Kawhy? To stay and they will win a championship every other year in 2019, 2021, and 2023.

**Toronto Raptors**

LeBron will sign with the Raptors just to check up on them and make sure they are ok.

**Utah Jazz**

LeBron loves jazz. He will sign with Utah only to find out they don’t actually have jazz. He will then force a trade to New Orleans to be close to real jazz and because he remembered that he loves smoothies.

**Washington Wizards**

LeBron loves politics. He will sign with the Wizards so he can play basketball and also become the next president of the United States in 2020.

“I know we’ve been led to believe it’s a safe and secure place, it is not safe. It is not secure,” he said. “The cameras they have there are grossly insufficient.”

hn38n0,Stephen Jackson’s response to DeSean Jackson’s anti-semetic post is very disappointing,"MODS- I am reposting this without calling Stephen Jackson anti-semetic in the title because one of you had said that was the problem with the first posts. Because DeSean’s post was a quote attributed to Hitler, it cannot be debated that it wasn’t anti-Semitic and thus I don’t see any possible errors with the title. PLEASE leave this up for discussion. We need some kind of discourse.

I’m amazed and shocked by this. For those who don’t know, [DeSean Jackson posted a quote from Hitler](https://imgur.com/gallery/gSb7eyd) (edit- now said to be Farrakhan but written as Hitler) last night on his Instagram. Stephen Jackson replied with [this video today](https://streamable.com/yk2vur) about the whole situation, saying Jackson was “speaking the truth” and trying to get educated. The comments of the post also encourage the same “Jews control everything” hate that have fueled terrors of the past, with [Stephen Jackson even replying to one of them.](https://imgur.com/a/7YFggCE?fbclid=IwAR325lH10U5judJVIOxr3o3Ay-OUV6k7muLRgMCYMTzQxkoNVZPS58Cy-uI)

I’m extremely disappointed by Stephen Jackson (who has been a face of BLM) as well as this not getting traction in the media yet and even getting removed here. We say we are anti-hate but we can’t have double standards when we do so.

**EDIT-** Stephen Jackson deleted the video and has posted [this](https://www.instagram.com/p/CCXdZpzlVEf/), basically doubling down on his comments with a follow-up just as infuriating as the first post. He has seen a bit of backlash on IG (and some praise) but this should really be a bigger story given his platform and following. **How is it getting almost no traction in the NBA world?** The majority of the responses to this thread here have been really encouraging to see, and to the people commenting “Well, Jews do run everything”… I urge you to read about how dangerous this notion has been in history, particularly in the context of the Holocaust. Lastly, u/Daveed1297 DMd me to use this space to help get a petition he created a bit of traction.

brvala,I sold Josh Hart a Switch in 2017. And he still owes me. (Repost from /Lakers),"#UPDATE: http://imgur.com/gallery/c8btRei

Justice is served! Josh reach out and sent me this.
Thank you everyone for you help and turning this into a success story!!!!!

Back in the summer of 2017, we drafted Josh Hart out of Villanova with the 30th pick. I loved the pick cause I knew the kid was a baller and gave us some nice depth.
He made a tweet that summer while he was in Vegas getting ready for the summer league, about wanting to buy a Nintendo Switch. My little brother jokingly replied to him without expecting a response, but to our surprise, he did.
The conversation went as follows:

 http://imgur.com/gallery/WkSFMJm

We agreed on 200 dollars, tickets to a future game and the chance to meet with him for a Switch and Zelda Breath of the Wild. I shipped it to him overnight. As a life long Laker fan (I have a tattoo so I'm not playing around) I was ecstatic at having some kind of connection to a Laker, let alone one I genuinely liked.

He did PayPal me the 200 right when he got it, and he did reach out to me about what tickets I wanted. I asked him for the December 18th game...which was Kobe Bryant's jersey retirement. I knew the odds of getting those tickets were slim, but of course I'm going to shoot my shot at that game.

That was the last I heard from him. I have reached out to him through my personal Twitter, and my brother has attempted to as well. He reads the message, but never replies. I have joined his Twitch live streams and tried to get his attention there too, and he seems to ignore me there too.

I have no ill will towards the man, I just want what we had agreed upon and not be ghosted. I feel waiting 2 seasons and still no tickets is pretty absurd at this point, and the lack of communication is the real ball buster.

So please Josh....just pay up bro.

“My girls and I want to thank the millions of people who’ve shown support and love during this horrific time. Thank you for all the prayers. We definitely need them. We are completely devastated by the sudden loss of my adoring husband, Kobe — the amazing father of our children; and my beautiful, sweet Gianna — a loving, thoughtful, and wonderful daughter, and amazing sister to Natalia, Bianka, and Capri. We are also devastated for the families who lost their loved ones on Sunday, and we share in their grief intimately. There aren’t enough words to describe our pain right now. I take comfort in knowing that Kobe and Gigi both knew that they were so deeply loved. We were so incredibly blessed to have them in our lives. I wish they were here with us forever. They were our beautiful blessings taken from us too soon. I’m not sure what our lives hold beyond today, and it’s impossible to imagine life without them. But we wake up each day, trying to keep pushing because Kobe, and our baby girl, Gigi, are shining on us to light the way. Our love for them is endless — and that’s to say, immeasurable. I just wish I could hug them, kiss them and bless them. Have them here with us, forever. Thank you for sharing your joy, your grief and your support with us. We ask that you grant us the respect and privacy we will need to navigate this new reality. To honor our Team Mamba family, the Mamba Sports Foundation has set up the MambaOnThree Fund to help support the other families affected by this tragedy. To donate, please go to MambaOnThree.org. To further Kobe and Gianna’s legacy in youth sports, please visit MambaSportsFoundation.org.

Thank you so much for lifting us up in your prayers, and for loving Kobe, Gigi, Natalia, Bianka, Capri and me. #Mamba #Mambacita #GirlsDad #DaddysGirls #Family ❤️”

byskdn,The Outrage of NBA Fans is Disproportionate.,"I'd like to preface this by stating that what GSW part-owner Mark Stevens did in game 3 was unacceptable. He pushed Kyle Lowry and deserves to be fined and suspended from attending games.

&nbsp;

However, it is my opinion that the outcry has been wildly disproportionate to other acts of violence in the NBA.

&nbsp;

I realise that it was less about the fact that the 60 year old Silicon Valley venture capitalist might've hurt Lowry with his left handed push and was more just the fact that he laid his hands on a player in an unfriendly way. 

&nbsp;

The public outcry has been intense. People are calling for a lifetime ban and demanding that he be forced to sell his shares in the team. The incident is already written on his Wikipedia page.

&nbsp;

People are out for blood with Kyle Lowry leading the charge.

&nbsp;

>""A guy like that, showing his true class, and he shouldn't be a part of our league. There's just no place for that.""

&nbsp;

>""The support I've gotten from fellow players, the league, has been unbelievable. With that being said, I think more should be done.""

&nbsp;

>""I have 2 young children and being able to hold myself to a certain standard. Which I do. I hold myself to a high, high standard.""

&nbsp;

These are all quotes from Kyle Lowry. The same Kyle Lowry who in 2012 pled guilty to the battery of a female referee at a charity basketball game. 

&nbsp;

This was one of his quotes on that day:

&nbsp;

>""B****, meet me outside. I will kick your a**!""

&nbsp;

He then proceeded to throw a basketball at her for a second time, as hard as he could. He (potentially) received a fine of up to $1,000 and was suspended for 0 games. 500 times less than Mark Stevens got for his push. The fine was from a judge in a courtroom and not even from the league. The league did nothing. There is no mention of this on Lowry's wikipedia page. 

&nbsp;

If Lowry thinks $500,000 and a year ban is soft for Mark Stevens then I wonder what he thought about his $0, 0 game punishment for battery of a woman in 2012?

&nbsp;

In August of 2010, beloved NBA clown Lance Stephenson pushed his pregnant girlfriend down a staircase and then proceeded to bash her head against the stairs. 

&nbsp;

Two years prior to this he sexually assaulted a 17 year old girl at his high school.

&nbsp;

He went on to play over 500 NBA games and earn over $35 million dollars. 

&nbsp;

At the time of the staircase attack, he hadn't played a single NBA game. 9 years later, he's still in the league. 

&nbsp;

I was a fan of Lance but only because I'd never heard this mentioned in a single one of his games. I even paid actual money to buy his Charlotte Hornets jersey. I wore his name and number on my back. Call me old fashioned, but I think that the second you bash your pregnant girlfriend's head against some stairs, you should forfeit the privilege of playing NBA basketball.

&nbsp;

OJ Mayo and Tyreke Evans were both given 2 year bans for violating the NBA anti-drug program. The NBA is prohibited from disclosing what type of drugs they were found to have taken but reports suggest the violations were related to ""drugs of abuse"" which implies they were recreational and not performance enhancing.

&nbsp;

Jason Kidd was fined $200 (by a judge) for abusing his wife. He was suspended for 0 games.

&nbsp;

Darren Collison, Jason Kidd, Jason Richardson. The NBA has a history of letting abusers off lightly. All just because they're good at basketball.

&nbsp;

I'm a firm believer in forgiveness and giving people second chances but if Kyle Lowry and NBA fans think Mark Stevens should be banned for life then Kyle Lowry should've never become a Raptor, Jason Kidd should not be the league's highest paid assistant coach and Lance Stephenson should've never played a minute in the NBA.

Lin has engaged in a number of forums discussing the issue of violence against Asians, including one last year with former NBA player Caron Butler, Indian American civil-rights attorney Vanita Gupta and one-time presidential candidate Andrew Yang.

It’s the kind of group, spanning several specific ethnicities, that are imperative to gain real traction against discrimination of any kind, certainly that which leads to violence.

“I’ve always said that in the long run, it can’t only be Asians caring about Asian issues, or African Americans caring about African American issues,” Lin says. “If, as minorities, we want the majority to understand what it’s like to live a minority experience, and to sympathize and change, we as minorities also have to collaborate, unify and use our voices and stand up for each other.

He’s not confused or misunderstood, he’s a bigot. *He chose to be a bigot.*

If you spend two minutes on twitter right now you will see the astonishing amount of harm he has *already* done by promoting this movie and these disgusting anti-Semitic conspiracy theories. It’s not our job to coddle him and hold his hand and lead him to the light.

ogbc5j,ESPN/ABC’s Game 1 halftime coverage was 75.2% ads.,"I (and a lot of others) have been fed up with just how little actual content there is in ESPN’s halftime show. I decided to time it down to the second:

The time between the first half buzzer and the opening tick of the second half was **16:03**. Of that time: 

**-2:01 (12.6%) was spent with the play-by-play crew.**

**-1:58 (12.3%) was spent with the halftime crew.**

**-12:04 (75.2%) was ads.**



To-the-second breakdown:

0:00 First half buzzer (followed by 37 seconds with the play-by-play crew)

0:37 “Is brought to you by…” (lasts 15 seconds)

0:52 First add break (2 minutes 12 seconds)

3:04 Highlight interlude with the play-by pay guys (15 seconds)

3:19 First add break continues (1 minute 32 seconds)

4:51 Halftime crew does analysis (1 minute 32 seconds)

6:23 Second ad break (3 minutes 41 seconds)

10:04 Halftime crew does first-half highlights (26 seconds)

10:30 Third ad break (4 minutes 24 seconds)

14:54 Play-by-play crew is back (1 minute 9 seconds)

16:03 Second half clock starts


----------
Edit: I did the same thing for Game 2, and the results were very similar. 1:34 was spent with the halftime crew; 12:06 (74.5%) was ads.

8u2b2t,Why Lebron James should come to the Orlando Magic: A last plea.,"Dear Mr. Bron,

Look bitch, I'm gonna cut it straight.  I don't have a fancy pitch like the rest of these teams.  I'm just gonna be real.  We're desperate dude. The troops are low on morale and I don't think they'll survive another winter like this.  I know we don't have much, but I'm gonna try to at least show you what we have.  Any help will do.  We'll even take Bronny Jr.  Right now.

1. **We've got young meat who will do literally whatever you say.** -  We've got a lot of talent, and absolutely no ego whatsoever. We're the South Central Louisiana State Mud Dogs of the NBA. You can make the rest of the team wash your feet between quarters and they'd do it.  This will be a drama free zone.  You're the king and they are your squires.  But like, please don't abuse this power and sell anyone into human trafficking rings or anything.  I know Evan's got a pretty mouth but don't okay

2.  **Orlando is a trash city just like Cleveland** - Look, you're an Ohio boy through and through.  You'd hate Los Angeles.  Buncha liberal hippies with their ""activated charcoal"" and their ""functioning state government"" and all that other PC nonsense.  You dont need that in your life.  Plus those taxes are you kidding me?  Nobody in Florida pays taxes.  If you can prove to the state that you're physically capable of tackling a gator, you don't have to pay state taxes.

3. **We're about as physically far away from Golden State as you can get.**
 
4. **...""But what about Miami?""** - Miami can eat my ass.  You've already been there Bron.  They're gonna expect 2010 Bron and when father time eventually catches up with you in 2050 they're gonna riot and start calling you names in spanish.  You don't want that kinda stress in your life.  Anybody who would call you names in spanish lives far away in Kissimmee.  We will protect you.

5. **The kids love Disney** - You're a family man now Bron.  Think about the kids.  I mean who wouldn't love all year access to Disney World?  Who doesn't love 10 dollar bottles of water and roaving hoardes of Brazilian teens yelling at birds and stuff?  It's great for the whole family.

No rush bron.  I'm just sayin, think about it.",21732,1170,YungSnuggie,2018-06-26 18:14:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/8u2b2t/why_lebron_james_should_come_to_the_orlando_magic/,0.88,False,False,False,False

It's not just the players. The league has been practically dead silent too. All they've done thus far is put out a [statement in which they spelled ""anti-semitic"" incorrectly,](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FgRd4GXXwAIS7lj?format=jpg&name=orig) one which has since been deleted. Nice to know they care so much about anti-semitism that they can't even spell it right.

8xkmtb,Carmelo Anthony was never a top 5 player. Not even once.,"I was in the ""538 Hates Melo"" thread, about to reply to someone arguing ""Melo actually used to be top 5,"" then I decided, fuck it. I've *always* hated melo's game. 

What follows is me trying to illustrate that not only was Melo not a top 5 player *of his era*, he was never a top 5 player at all.  Not even fucking once. I'm doing this for me.

### Melo, at a glance
* only twice made it out of the first round
* 215th all-time in ws/48, tied with Corey Maggette
* not in top 250 for career TS%
* not in top 250 for career Offensive Rating
* made up for this relative inefficiency by not passing much or trying on defense
* [tried to combat questions about work ethic by posting video of himself jogging](https://www.instagram.com/p/BWCHXsYDoXx/?utm_source=ig_embed)
* [this entire article](http://www.espn.com/espn/feature/story/_/id/11904296/new-york-knicks-forward-carmelo-anthony-wants-bulletproof-reputation)

#### The Most Overated Player of his Era

Anthony has made 10 all-star games, and was often cited  as a top 5 player.

Carmelo's net offensive and defensive rating are the exactly the same (108). That means he's giving up a lot of what he gives you. And 108, as mentioned above, isn't anything special.

###Melo in Denver 
""Melo was actually good in denver!"" Sure!  ""Melo was a top 5 player in denver!"" [No.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DCJXYbBB7w) While more dynamic than his plodding, interminably jab-stepping, Knicks iteration, he was never actually a top 5 player. He only made it out of the first round once.
 
####First: Melo has never been better than LeBron. 
Lebron was born on December 30th, 1984. He was immediately better than Carmelo. Every second since that moment, LeBron has been increasing the distance between them. They came into the league at the same moment: one committed to perpetual improvement, the other, Carmelo Anthony. Twin spaceships traveling at different velocities. To calculate the distance between them now, you'd have to figure out some way to make Melo's spaceship actually start going in reverse and then explode. I'm too dumb to figure that out, so we're moving on.

####Second: Denver Melo was  *never* better than Kobe or Dirk
From 2005-2012, there wasnt a single season he was better than Kobe or Dirk. Melo *never* finishes above these guys in all-nba over this period. Not once. More importantly, with the benefit of retrospect, we can see these two (along with LeBron) were great every season, always healthy, and whenever they had *any* talent around them, contended for titles/MVPs. They got everything out of their team, year after year. There's not a single season you wouldn't trade Melo for one of these three and improve Denver.  (To preemptively shut down the idea Melo was better than Dirk in 2009, when he beat the Mavs in the second round: Dirk averaged 34/12/4 on 53/38/92 shooting in that series--if you put Dirk on that Nuggets team, they would've been even better. Dirk was also 1st team All-Nba to Melo's 3rd. Melo also didn't even make the all-star team.)

So: Melo is at best, the 4th best player any season from 2005-2012. I now just have to establish that there were at least *2* other guys who were better each season during that period, and I can knock Denver Melo out of the top 5 rankings.

#### Numbers 4, 5, 6 
Here i'm going to list three players (in any order), that I think were conclusively better than Melo in each corresponding season. Why three, when I only need two? Because fuck Melo. Honestly, in a lot of these seasons I could list ~10+ players. Finally, just because someone like Nash or Duncan drops out doesnt necessarily mean I think they're no longer better than Melo--they probably are--it's just that there are 3 more inarguable players. 

##### 2005-2011
2005 | 2006 | 2007| 2008 | 2009 | 2010 | 2011

Duncan | Duncan | Duncan | CP3 | CP3 | Durant | Durant
Shaq | Wade | Wade | Garnett | Wade | Wade | Wade



### Melo in New York
Unlike his team USA compatriots, Melo was uninterested in forming a superteam, instead taking the money and forcing his way to the Knicks. While not as athletic as Denver Melo, it was in NYC where Anthony peaked as a shooter. It's also here where he gained more weight and started missing lots of games. He won *one* playoff series in his entire time with the Knicks. In the east, guys.

And then it got worse. Knicks Melo never made the playoffs, let alone an all-nba team after 2013, so we can pretty much throw all those years out for top 5 purposes. Just because people still *thought* he was good, I went all the way to 2015, where became pretty clear he's wasnt even top 15 anymore. Kobe and Dirk start declining here, so I expanded it to **4** players besides LeBron. Still wasnt very hard. Durant basically slots in for Dirk as the new non-Lebron forward always clearly ahead of Melo.

As a sidenote: the Denver Nuggets won more games than the Knicks in 3 of the next 4 seasons (including 57 in 2012), and only finished behind in 2014 by 1 game (37 to 36). 
 
##### 2012-2015

Kobe | Duncan | Steph | Steph |
Durant | Durant | Durant | Durant |
CP3 | CP3 | CP3 | Westbrook | 
Dwight | M.Gasol | Harden | Harden |

##### 2013: The year Melo might have been top 5
Ok, even I have to admit this. In 2013, Melo has a decent case for his only top 5 season. He leads the league in scoring, shoots a good percentage, and even wins a playoff series. It's by far his best season as a Knick, and likely, the best season of his career. He has a career high in ws/48, with .184, and finishes 9th overall in offensive win shares (really high for him).

Melo also finishes 3rd in MVP voting, and while I think this is partially because of his exaggerated reputation at the time (and being in NYC), he did have a great year. 

Still though: LeBron, Durant, clearly better. CP3 has far better advanced stats and won more games in a harder conference.  Tim Duncan makes 1st team all-nba, and is the best player on the Spurs team that goes to the finals. Marc Gasol wins Defensive player of the year, wins more games, and goes to the western conference finals. He finishes *3rd* in VoRP behind LeBron and Durant. It's counter-intuitive, but Gasol has a really strong argument. That's 5, but we also have Harden and Curry starting to push their way into the conversation, and honestly, I'd take either of them over Melo in 2013. That's 7. 

Maybe I'm wrong there. Maybe Melo was top 5 in 2013. But that would be his *one* year as a top 5 player. One very debatable season. The next year he misses the playoffs and falls out of the conversation forever.

hzej5j,[OC] Taco Tuesdays have eaten into LeBron’s productivity and I have the data to prove it.,"One of the most unappetizing developments in the NBA is LeBron James’ recent obsession with Taco Tuesdays[.](https://imgur.com/a/TzuaeHS) And I’m not talking about the broader issue of [cultural appropriation](https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2019/11/12/20940959/lebron-james-taco-tuesday-videos-lakers-problem) or his sad [attempt to trademark](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2851790-lebron-james-files-to-trademark-taco-tuesday-after-viral-social-media-posts) the phrase. I’m talking about how the King’s curious obsession with eating tacos on Tuesdays, has led to him eating Ls on the box score.

Almost every culture has a kind of taco. The Greeks have gyros. The French have crepes. Italians have calzones. Americans have Taco Bell. Folding dough around a medley of meat and veggies is a food concept as old as time. And while everyone enjoys tacos, some of us are more fanatic than others…

Enter [El Reye](https://www.elreytaqueria.com/), LeBron James.

<[LeBron James Taco Tuesday Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9YRDVaW1qA4)\>

The man’s awkward passion for Taco Tuesday tends to evoke mixed reactions: anywhere between smiling at the heartwarming dad vibes and a literal whole-body cringe. And I won’t deny, as a proper Houstonian who takes his tacos very seriously, I was suspicious when I first heard grumblings of the [Ohio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_by_Hispanic_and_Latino_population)\-native’s weekly affair. So, I looked to the numbers to see if there is more to this meat-and-cheese filled story.

# “It’s just like Taco Tuesdays. It’s a (expletive) thing.”

Before biting into the data, I needed to pinpoint the origins of James’ taco-bsession (taco-obsession, hehe). After an exhaustive multi-minute googling sesh, the earliest observance I could find is this [Instagram story](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=507218733062687) from August 2018.

Just a few weeks later we got further confirmation of LeBron’s enthusiasm for weekday alliteration-themed occasions during a post-practice Q&A. His fervent response to the media’s questions about his “[White Boy Wednesdays](https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/lakers/2018/09/26/lebron-lakers-eminem-white-boy-wednesday/1437137002/)” playlist gave it all away:

>*“It’s a universal thing, right?’’ he asked reporters, with a smile. “It’s just like taco Tuesdays. It’s a (expletive) thing.”*

*It’s a (expletive) thing.* Profound words with profound implications. It’s at this point we can confidently presume Taco Tuesday is a staple in the James house. His videos would increase in frequency and social media buzz throughout the 2018-19 season before reaching a zeitgeist level of furor with this May ‘19 [insta-story](https://twitter.com/BleacherReport/status/1133586182720430080?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1133586182720430080%7Ctwgr%5E&ref_url=about%3Ablank).

Thus, we can split LeBron’s career is into two distinct periods:

* **Pre-Taco Tuesday Era**: 2003-04 – 2017-18 seasons
* **Taco Tuesday Era**: 2018-19 – 2019-20 seasons

With a reliable taco timeline established, it’s time to count the beans.

# The Taco-nalysis

I began by compiling LeBron’s career game logs (the population) and identifying the day of the week each game was played on. Next, I pulled in his Season Averages (the control group) and selected the following 10 stat categories to get a comprehensive picture of his performance: [Game Score](https://www.nba.com/resources/static/team/v2/thunder/statlab-gamescore-191201.pdf), Points, Field Goal %, 3-Point %, Free Throw %, Total Rebounds, Assists, Steals, Blocks, and Turnovers. For each of these stats, I compared his average performance for each day of the week to his overall average for the corresponding season.

Example: for the 2003-04 NBA season, LeBron averaged 20.9 Points per game. On Sundays that season, he averaged 26.6 Points per game. So, for Sunday during the ‘03-04 season, LeBron had a Points per game variance of +27.3%. This calculation is repeated for each day of the week for each of the 10 stat categories for each of LeBron’s seasons in the league.

<[Example of Analysis](https://imgur.com/r1tNBxo)\>

A 5% variance threshold was used to clearly delineate between good and bad performances. Meaning, daily stat averages greater than +5% of the season average are considered “Positive” (green), variances less than -5% are considered “Negative” (red) and variances within those bounds are considered “Neutral” (yellow). This threshold divided the data points into the three stratums equally.

# Pre-Taco Tuesday Era

This analysis examined 1,050 total data points from the period before LeBron discovered tacos (10 stats x 7 days per week x 15 seasons) and found an unambiguous trend: The King played better on [*Tuesdays*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CaA9EBPgdQI).

<[Pre-Taco Tuesday Era - % of Variances by Day of Week](https://imgur.com/lweNvDu)\>

Since LeBron entered the league, his Tuesday night performances had registered the lowest rate of Negative variances and the highest rate of Positive variances. Meaning, Tuesday is the day he was *least* likely to perform *worse* than his season average, and the day he was *most* likely to perform *better* than his season average.

When looking at the stat variances cumulatively, his Tuesday performance stands out even more!

<[Pre-Taco Tuesday Era - Cumulative Avg Stat Variances by Day of Week](https://imgur.com/ZLRuKu2)\>

Tuesdays had a Total Average Variance of 2.4%. Meaning, in the pre-Taco Tuesday era, LeBron posted an average stat line +2.4% better than his season average on Tuesday nights.

And with LeBron being undoubtedly the best player on his teams, we’d expect that Tuesday performance bump to be reflected in the Win/Loss column… It was.

<[Pre Taco-Tuesday Era - Win % by Day of Week](https://imgur.com/OYsznFX)\>

He came out victorious in 71% of his Tuesday outings in the pre-Taco Tuesday era - more than 4% better than his overall win rate for the same period.

This is where things get bleak. LeBron-stans, now would be the time to log off.

# Oh, How the Tacos have Turned

Everyone thought LeBron’s biggest weakness was his hairline. Turns out, it’s tacos.

Prior to his weekly taco tradition, LeBron’s Tuesday performance had the lowest rate of negative variances and the highest rate of positive variances. In the first two seasons of the Taco Tuesday era, James’ sacred day saw an +11% uptick in negative variances and a -17% drop in positive variances.

<[Taco Tuesday Era - % of Variances by Day of Week](https://imgur.com/9U52kqx)\>

Looking at the stats in aggregate we get an even better sense for his drop in Tuesday performance. LeBron is suddenly performing notably worse than his season average in most of the key stats! A complete reversal of the trend from the days before his taco titillations.

<[Taco Tuesday Era - Cumulative Avg Stat Variances by Day of Week](https://imgur.com/7yqOxme)\>

Suffice it to say, LeBron’s average Tuesday performance has fallen flatter than Casa Ole’s® velveeta-covered tostada. For those of you residing outside the great state of Texas, allow this trip advisor review to enlighten you on our state’s worst Mexican chain.

<[Casa Ole Review](https://imgur.com/gsPK5cA)\>

Similar to how Montezuma’s revenge transforms local cuisines into violent bowel movements, we’d expect LeBron’s *shitty* Tuesday performance to translate to the Win/Loss column… it did.

<[Taco Tuesday Era - Win % by Day of Week](https://imgur.com/5CW6EPT)\>

Since the weekday shenanigans began, LeBron’s Tuesday Win % has lagged his overall Win % by -2%.

To put all these numbers into perspective, here’s a few Taco-mparisons for you to consider.

# Taco-mparison

These graphs give a sense of just how different LeBron’s Tuesday nights were in the two eras.

&#x200B;

# Ta co-nclude

It’s becoming difficult to separate LeBron’s on-court performance from his escalating taco mania. Whether he’s [sending taco trucks](https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/lakers/2019/10/29/lebron-james-sends-taco-truck-feed-first-responders-california-wildfires/2501709001/) to the California firefighters, leading the Staples Center in an [arena-wide taco chant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5xC5OOgK4s), or his recent feature on Migos’ *Taco Tuesday* track – LeBron has progressively made the Latin street food a part of his identity.

<[*Taco Tuesday* track](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3aDutHedqM)\>

After examining 17 seasons of data the findings are clear: LeBron James’ Tuesday performance has gotten measurably worse since his Taco Tuesday antics began.

So, what does this mean for LeBron and the Lakers?

Well, in the short run, they don’t have too much to worry about. The NBA curiously scheduled no Tuesday night matchups for the Lakers in the bubble restart. I don’t mean to stoke the r/nba conspiracy flames but if that sus pattern holds for the playoff schedule, we’ll need an official response from Adam Silver.

<[Lakers Bubble Schedule](https://imgur.com/a/AKPAKSr)\>

*Note: the author* [*contacted the*](https://imgur.com/a/1ofjV3y) *the NBA League Office for comment but they did not respond prior to posting on reddit.*

Looking past the current season, however, should Jeanie Buss and the Lakers consider intervening?

On the one hand, LeBron should face the mariachi music and acknowledge the way he’s let down his teammates, coaches and fans these past two taco-slowed seasons.

On the other hand, despite his Tuesday distraction and the performance decline it’s wrought, LeBron had an MVP-caliber season and led his team to the #1 seed in the Western conference[.](https://media.giphy.com/media/26Fxuue3LMkwbs3Sg/giphy.gif)

What his teammates, coaches and fans deserve most is an unencumbered LeBron. An on-court LeBron who’s fully present *every* time he suits up; undistracted by the allure of alliteration themed dinner nights. And, an off-court LeBron who can freely indulge his primal taco impulses each and every Tuesday night. A LeBron so fully self-actualized it’d make Michael stop crying.

Thus, the data offers but one solution: **Taco Load Management**

Frank Vogel should rest LeBron on Tuesday nights so he can pursue his conflicting passions uninhibited.

c8wgi4,‘Twas the night before Kawhismas,"‘Twas the night before Kawhismas and all through r/nba, not a keyboard was silent, not even a... mouse. 

The shitposts were posted by nephews with care, 
in hopes that sweet upvotes soon would be there,

The Canadians were nestled all snug at Tim Hortons, visions of Nav dancing, they cried out “oh Board Man” 

And Magic in LA and Ballmer there too,
They’d just calmed the hell down, which was long over due.

When all of a sudden there arose a new tweet, 
People sprang to hit new, to see who had who beat. 

Away to their phones they flew like a flash
They smashed on f5, and prayed the whole internet didn’t crash.

Lebron sees his chance of a new superteam grow, 
But ask him if it is one and I’m sure he’ll say no,

When what to our wondering eyes should appear,
Why a brand new post right there in the clear,

With a little bold writer, so lively and quick,
I knew in that moment a woj bomb I did click,

More rapid than raptors his words they came,
And he stayed very silent, his sources he never names,

Now SIMMONS, now SHAMS, now SKIP and SHANNON, 
on RDA, on Masai, on Windhorst and JALEN,

To the top of the window! To the Top of r/all!
The excitement’s so palpable there’s sweat on my balls. 

As band wagoners that before a big trade trade fly,
When someone calls out their flair switch, they say “bye bitch, bye.”

False alarm?! Yes sadly, Woj did have some news,
about the Greek freak?!... YES! but just about his new shoes,

They sprang to their helicopter, the cameramen they did go, 
And away they all flew to a car, #tbt to that white bronco. 

But I heard the Klaw say as he drove out of sight,
He.He.He. Indubitably, Happy Kawhismas to all, and to r/all good night!",20396,504,OGsnowflake3,2019-07-04 01:28:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/c8wgi4/twas_the_night_before_kawhismas/,0.86,False,True,False,False

collc1,I sold Josh Hart a Nintendo Switch in 2017. And he has paid me back,"A few months ago I posted about my situation with now former Los Angeles Lakers Guard, Josh Hart. If your not familiar with the story, [here it is](https://np.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/brvala/i_sold_josh_hart_a_switch_in_2017_and_he_still/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x).

I never expected it to get the kind of attention it did. My plan was to share a pretty unique story with people, hopefully get Josh's attention and just get some tickets. Comments were hilarious and people's opinions are always good to read. I was pretty taken back with the kind of support people where willing to give me, one person going as far as to wanting to start a GoFundMe to get some tickets. So just a quick shout out to the people of Reddit, you guys are amazing.

July 6th, the Lakers acquired Anthony Davis. The Woj Bomb hit my phone and when I came across Josh Hart's name in the trade, I couldn't help but laugh. My friends hitting me up about it and even some Redditors taking some jabs at me. [Sacrifices had to be made I suppose.](https://np.reddit.com/r/lakers/comments/c134ht/some_sacrifices_had_to_be_made_for_anthony_davis/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) Josh and I actually contacted each other a few times over Twitter after the trade. He assured me that he was still going to take care of me, and I wasn't in any kind of rush. The kid just got traded, and I imagine for a young player that can be pretty hectic.

[He sent me a box in the mail.](https://imgur.com/a/gvtdKou) A pair of Nike Lakers Shorts, a Lakers warm up shirt, a Lakers long sleeve shirt, 2 hats and a bag. But the cherry on top...a pair of signed game worn Kobe's, and a signed game worn number 5 rookie Josh Hart jersey. I have never owned anything game worn before, so I was floored. The smile this put on my face made me realize, I am completely happy with what I got.

Being a life long Lakers fan, I jumped at the opportunity to sell a Laker something just to have a cool story out of it. At the end of the day, I have a better story than I could have imagined. Am I going to get tickets? I don't know, and I'm not expecting them. I can always buy tickets, (as expensive as they may be) but this story and what I got in the end is worth more to me than tickets.

If there is anything more that I could ask for I guess, would be to meet Josh in person and have a laugh about all of this. That, and maybe a few rounds of Smash Bros. 4 stock, no items, Final Destination. I play a pretty mean Snake.

Edit: Apologies if I came off as asking for more. That was not my intention whatsoever. I could've made a better choice of words, but I don't expect anymore. I could've done without the smash Bros comment, but I wasn't asking for more. I got more than I asked for.",20176,998,ssmith2452,2019-08-10 18:20:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/collc1/i_sold_josh_hart_a_nintendo_switch_in_2017_and_he/,0.87,False,True,False,False

**Context:** On March 25, 2021, after 6 years in Toronto, Powell was traded from the Toronto Raptors to the Portland Trail Blazers in exchange for Gary Trent Jr. and Rodney Hood. 
This is his farewell letter to the Toronto Raptors.

Wow this is beautiful, I recommend reading all of it


>It was straight-up waterworks. I started breaking down crying … all the memories that I’d been holding back for those last couple of days, they came rushing back in.

>Jama and I took a walk down the hall, had a heart-to-heart, talked about my future, talked about how it’s okay to have these emotions, talked about how so many changes in life can end up being blessings in disguise.

>Then we ran into Kyle, and I’ll be honest ... I had to cry some more. Kyle, along with DeMar, he’s been my true vet, so there’s a lot of history there. And when I saw him, he just embraced me — let me get those emotions out. And then he gave me one final piece of Kyle wisdom. 

>He said, “You will always be a part of this history.”

>Damn.

>And then I ran into Fred.

>So by the time I ran into Fred, it had been a minute now since those waterworks. But if you’ve ever cried like that, you know: even after that sh*t dries ... you’re still not fooling anyone.

>And Fred obviously doesn’t miss a thing.

>First thing he says when he sees me, he goes, “Oh, man. You was crying?” 

>And I just sort of hang my head a little, and laugh. And then Fred laughs. 

>He’s like, “It’s alright, brother. Thugs cry too. It’s cool, bro.”

>That moment with Fred, it meant a lot. He’s my best friend. But beyond that, I feel like he’s been this driving force behind a lot of how I’ve grown as a player ... and vice versa. That’s just how it’s always been with us. We’ve pushed each other. As competitors, for sure — it’s that second-round pick / undrafted dude hunger, I think. That underdog mentality. I mean, we had to stop playing one-on-one against each other, there had to be a ban on it, because of how competitive we got, all the little scraps we would get in. But it was always about friendship with us first.

k3bhqs,Kevin Love's recent interview about suicidal thoughts and mental health pushed me to finally get help,"I have obsessively read mental health, self help, healing books over the years, but for some reason seeing wealthy and successful athletes talk about it hits different for me. Brilliant doctors and authors have made me think about this stuff, but I never took action until I saw the Kevin Love piece.

It's like, Kevin Love has everything I ever wanted, or think I wanted in life, but yet those achievements don't fix the underlying problem. From the books I've read and what I've experienced on a micro-level I know this to be true logically, but that never inspired me to actually deal with this thing.

Something about Kevin Love's interview planted the seed, he didn't say anything I hadn't heard before but something about it just hit me in the chest and I have physically felt different since, and a couple days after watching it I just let everything spill and finally got honest with people around me and will be starting therapy tomorrow for the first time.

&#x200B;

Are there any other NBA players or pro athletes who speak out about these topics?

I know DeMar Derozan is doing a lot of work in this field as well, and then Dak Prescott from the NFL.

&#x200B;

For those who haven't seen the Kevin Love interview it's broken into a few different parts:

[Suicidal thoughts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k7Bekpvq3g&ab_channel=GrahamBensinger)

[Being vulnerable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Alr7viRv8yA&t=358s&ab_channel=GrahamBensinger)

&#x200B;

Hope everyone is doing OK, and my god, December 22nd can't come soon enough.

k96dyz,"Dwight Howard was the problem...no wait, Chris Paul was the problem...no wait, Russell Westbrook was the problem...no wait, James Harden is the problem in Houston","I want to make the point that James Harden’s lack of leadership skills costed the Houston Rockets their chance of winning the championship. Especially considering how close they were in beating the Warriors even with Chris Paul’s injury, at the end of the day the leader of the team should bear the responsibility. From petty fights with CP3 to running him out of town, and now showing the owners that he doesn’t want to play no more, it’s just not a good sight to see in a superstar leader.

If you are the leader of the team, you have to be willing to sacrifice the most, and give 200%, hoping that you inspire your teammates to follow through.

Yes, he was the MVP, yes he’s top 5 player in the league statistically speaking, but is he a player that most NBA players look up to in a leader?",19544,2084,Slow-fingers,2020-12-08 15:39:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/k96dyz/dwight_howard_was_the_problemno_wait_chris_paul/,0.84,False,False,False,False

>“In years past, this league has been great because the players have led the way and they have strong voices,” Miller said. “When Donald Sterling stepped in it, when Robert Sarver just recently stepped in it, our voices in the basketball community and our players were vocally strong in some type of discipline being handed down — or be gone.

>“The players have dropped the ball on this case when it’s been one of their own. It’s been crickets,” Miller added. “And it’s disappointing, because this league has been built on the shoulders of the players being advocates. Right is right and wrong is wrong. And if you’re gonna call out owners, and rightfully so, then you’ve got to call out players as well. You can’t go silent in terms of this for Kyrie Irving. I want to hear the players and their strong opinions as well, just as we heard about Robert Sarver and Donald Sterling.”

> Gay: The most he talked was on the hard court, and Kawhi was not afraid to let you know that you weren’t going to score on him, that you couldn’t get past him or that he would score on you. Every time the ball went through the net, he just said, “Bucket. Bucket.” That was it.

> Tyrone Shelley, guard: Most people say it like, “Oh, I’m about to get buckets on you.” He was just like, “Buckets. Layup.” Just one word.

> Shelton: He’d be like, “You’re not scoring. You’re not doing anything.” Or he’d be like, “No, no, no.” He’d just move his feet and say, “No.”

> Gay: You couldn’t score on him, so that’s what he would say: “Nope, nope, nope.” And when he would score on you: “Bucket. Bucket.”

> LaBradford Franklin, guard: If he was grabbing a rebound, he’d say, “Give me that” or “Board man” or “Board man gets paid.”

> Coach Hutson: If I heard it once, I heard it 50 times. “Board man. I’m a board man.” That’s what he said. Absolutely. “I’m a board man. Yeah, I’m a board man. Board man gets paid.” He spoke in phrases like that.

> Shelley: Instead of saying, “We need to walk to the store” or “Let’s go to the store,” he’d just say, “I’m up.” When he leaves, he just says, “I’m up.”

More Klay stories below:
>Jack: We’re in Atlanta and we wanted to hang out at a nightclub. We’re all there, texting Klay, and he’s like, “Where are you guys at?” I’m like, “Yo, we’re over here.” He’s like, “Cool, I’m about to meet you guys.” So Klay comes, but when he walks in, he walks in by himself. I’m like, “Yo, man, how did you get here?” He’s like, “Yeah, man, I was hanging out at this bar, some people asked me where I was going, they said they were going to the same place, so, shit, I just hopped in the cab and split a cab with them.” I’m like, “What people?” He’s like, “That couple over there.” And it was like two married, middle-aged White people.

>DeGregorio: Klay’s first contract, they were negotiating, and in the middle he had to leave. He was like, “Guys, I have to go home now, I got to go home and feed my dog.”

&nbsp;

>DeGregorio: His rookie season, there was a game where Klay took too many 3s for Monta Ellis’s liking. During the next timeout, I remember Monta Ellis just ripped into this rookie: “You’re taking too many shots. Pass the ball. You’re just a rook.” That type of deal. I remember watching Klay the whole time, and he never flinched. He never wavered. The very next offensive possession, ball swings, goes to Klay. He takes the first shot and makes a 3. I’m thinking, “This kid is an ice-cold killer.”

>Ezeli: One game, I think we were up three with about 15 seconds left and somebody threw the ball to Klay. At this point, you just hold the ball, right? As soon as it touches his hands, Klay shoots it. I can’t remember if he made it or not, but I remember his conversation with Draymond afterwards. Draymond was like, “Yo, what were you doing?! Why would you shoot that?” And Klay said, “Dog, they pay me to shoot the ball.”",18798,954,GuyCarbonneauGOAT,2021-08-23 14:58:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/pa1izw/festus_ezeli_one_game_we_were_up_3_with_15/,0.94,False,False,False,False

[**Laura Ingraham of Fox News says LeBron James and Kevin Durant should just ""shut up and dribble""**](https://streamable.com/tdw2q)

---

**Transcript:**

>**I'm numb to this commentary, like! Must they run their mouths like that? Unfortunately, a lot of kids and some adults take these ignorant comments seriously. Look, there might be a cautionary lesson in LeBron for kids. This is what happens when you attempt to leave high school a year early to join the NBA. And it's always unwise to seek political advice from someone who gets paid a hundred million dollars a year to bounce a ball. Oh and LeBron and Kevin? You're great players but no one voted for you. Millions elected Trump to be their coach. So keep the political commentary to yourself, or as someone once said, ""shut up and dribble"".**

**[Bonus](https://streamable.com/7syqn) (she continued after returning from break):**

>**I'm still trying to get over the fact that Kevin Durant said, ""I feel like our country is not *ran* by a great coach."" Does that mean I should go for a *ran* tomorrow morning before my radio show? Oh my goodness.**
