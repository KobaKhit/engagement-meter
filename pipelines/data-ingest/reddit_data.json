{"id":"dt0ucg","title":"I analyzed James Harden's performance in every NBA city to see if there is a correlation between his box score and the city's average strip club rating.","selftext":"Everyone knows James Harden has a particular affinity for the Canadian ballet, aka strip clubs. After the Rocket's dismal performance in Miami last week, and the city's reputation for high quality tit-shacks, I became increasingly curious to see just how much James Harden's vice affects his game.  So here we are, I spent the better part of the week on this, hope y'all enjoy!\n\n**Hypothesis**: James Harden's box score declines in cities with high quality strip clubs\n\n**Test**: Analyze James Harden's performance in every NBA city and correlate with those cities' reputation for strip clubs to see if there is any discernible relationship.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Methodology\/Steps**:\n\n* First I extracted all of James Harden's game logs for the past 4 seasons from Basketball Reference, cleaned up the data a bit (a bunch), and appended it into a single worksheet.\n* Next, I filtered out all Home games and all games Harden was inactive or DNP. For the purpose of this analysis we did not look at home games.\n* **Poor Performances** were determined by variances in 6 stats: Points, FG%, 3PT%, FT%, Assists and Turnovers. For each of these stats I compared Harden's *overall* season average to the *city-specific* season average. I identified 2 categories of poor performances:\n\n1. Sub-Par - Harden performed WORSE than season average, and\n2. Very Sub-Par - Harden performed 20%+ WORSE than season average.\n\n* I analyzed his poor performances across each of the NBA\u2019s 28 different cities (did not look at home games so no Houston, there are 2 teams in LA, and I distinguished between Brooklyn and NYC = 28 cities).\n* **City Strip Club Rating** was determined by the average google review rating for the first 10 strip clubs in each city based on the google search \u201c\\[CITY\\] Strip Clubs\u201d (e.g., \u201cDetroit Strip clubs\u201d). Yes, this did involve me making like 30+ searches for strip clubs on my cpu...\n* Finally, I put the City Strip Club Rating into the pivoted game log data, performed a regression analysis and visualized it into charts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Conclusion**:\n\n>!I have proven, to a statistically significant degree, that James Harden\u2019s game performance declines in cities with higher rated strip clubs. !<\n\n>!Correlation Coefficient - r - (between avg strip club rating and total # of sub-par games) = .4575!<\n\n* >!Given the nature of the subject matter, this would be considered a moderate-to-strong correlation. !<\n\n>!Coefficient of Determination - r2 - (between avg strip club rating and total # of sub-par games) = .21!<\n\n* >!This means that James Harden\u2019s box score is 20% predictable based on the quality of a city\u2019s strip clubs !<\n\n>!Other interesting facts: !<\n\n* >!Harden\u2019s best performance comes in city with the worst strip clubs - Toronto!<\n* >!Harden\u2019s worst performance comes in city with the best strip clubs - Miami!<\n* >!Salt Lake city has the 3rd-ranked strip clubs of all NBA cities lol!<\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Link to all my work](https:\/\/docs.google.com\/spreadsheets\/d\/1hwDoaHcXqncb_l24NrxLCWTxE5pLaeKlU8r1Jnp39GQ\/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nThe charts won\u2019t upload perfectly to google docs so I have included [screenshots here](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/JEhHxkH)\n\n&#x200B;\n\ne. haha well this bl**e**w up.

{"id":"10nbau4","title":"Memphis Grizzlies scorekeeper posting fraudulent numbers","selftext":"MEMPHIS GRIZZLIES SCOREKEEPER POSTING FRAUDULENT NUMBERS FOR DEFENSIVE PLAYER OF THE YEAR LEADER JAREN JACKSON JR. \n\nI would like to bring to your attention the scorekeeper of the Memphis Grizzlies.\u00a0 I was wondering how a solid defensive player can suddenly have some specific statistical categories that are completely off the charts.\u00a0 I am referring to Jaren Jackson Jr., who, after having missed ~16 games to start the season due to off-season foot surgery immediately started having extreme outlier high steals + blocks statistics, leading the entire NBA in blocks per game by a wide margin.\u00a0 In fewer minutes per game than other players Jaron Jackson repeatedly gets outlandish block numbers at home. \n\nI decided to take a closer look at his games and IMMEDIATELY 1 thing became crystal clear.\u00a0 At home in Memphis he has 66 blocks in 16 home games, averaging 4.13 blocks per game, versus just 35 in 16 road games, averaging 2.19 in nearly identical minutes- an 89% increase in Memphis.\u00a0 In home games he has been credited with 22 steals in 16 home games, versus only 10 steals in 16 road games.\u00a0 This means he is averaging nearly 1.4 steals per game at home, but just 0.63 steals on the road per game- an astounding 120% increase in Memphis.\u00a0 In home games he has been credited with 88 blocks + steals, versus 45 on the road.\u00a0 This equates to an average of an outlandish 5.5 blocks+steals at home in limited minutes versus a reasonable and realistic, and still outstanding, 2.81 steals+blocks per game on the road.\u00a0 This equates to a 1.96X home stat increase only in these 2 categories.\u00a0 A 96% increase in performance specifically at home is truly an aberration which should be reviewed.\u00a0 This demonstrates the sort of incredulous statistics which calls for serious analysis. \n\nJust 3 out of his 14 games this season with 5+ blocks+steals have come on the road.\u00a0 8 out of 9 of his 6+ steals+blocks games have been recorded in Memphis.\u00a0 I decided to watch 2 memphis grizzlies games where he had one of his ludicrous 8+ blocks+steals games.\u00a0 By my count he actually had 3 fewer \"stocks\"(some people refer to steals+blocks as stocks) than he was credited for by the home scorekeeper.\u00a0 I wonder if the scorekeeper has some sort of vested interest in Jaren Jackson getting maximum high value defensive statistics that he thinks he can get away with putting down into the box score.\u00a0 \n\nJaren Jackson in July - mid November started as high as +10,000 for DPOY at certain sportsbooks after the Grizzlies announced he had undergone a procedure to address a stress fracture in his right foot and would be sidelined for 4-6 months.\u00a0 Now, in large part thanks to these blatantly wrong statistics, he is a huge odds on favorite at higher than -200. \n\nI conducted some analysis on all 78 games jaren jackson played last season... my hypothesis was that his home\/road difference on steals & blocks would both be small.\u00a0 He had 90 blocks in Memphis and 87 blocks on the road.\u00a0 He had 39 steals in Memphis and 34 steals on the road.\u00a0 He had 129 \"stocks\" in Memphis vs. 121 \"stocks\" on the road.\u00a0 BPG was actually 12.7% lower on the road(he played 4 fewer home games) while steals+blocks\/game was 15% lower on the road- higher than i expected, but reasonable given all the differences for Memphis when playing at home vs on the road, from their home\/away record difference to crowd noise to effort\/energy\/intensity exerted by players, etc.\n90%+ higher in Memphis, however, as is the case this season, is NOT REASONABLE AND COMPLETELY UNREALISTIC.\u00a0 My educated guess is that the Memphis scorekeeper(s) have been changed since last season and\/or ULTERIOR MOTIVES, INCENTIVES are now in play with respect to JJJ's defensive statistics. \n\nWhy is this happening so blatantly to the point where a person can just look at Jaren Jackson Jrs. steals+blocks #s on the box score and determine with a high level of confidence whether that game was played on the road or in Memphis is the next question... \n\nThree potential explanations, only one of which is innocent: \n\n1. Jaren Jackson plays MUCH MUCH MUCH harder at home and hustles like a maniac and focuses on stealing and blocking shots like crazy in Memphis, causing his numbers to be skewed in an absurd manner even compared to his regular highly efficient top 3- but realistic, road numbers. This can almost certainly be discounted because i looked at his other statistics and everything from his minutes per game to points per game to rebounds per game and even fouls are close in terms of home\/away splits. \n\n2. The Memphis scorekeeper is a huge Jaren Jackson Jr. fan and is purposely imbellishing his steals & blocks, since that is much easier to do than points or rebounds, for instance.\u00a0 When he contests a shot well, but does not touch the ball, perhaps the scorekeeper purposely gives him the undeserved stat and donates blocks to him where none occurred, for instance. \n\n3. It should also be investigated in this age of fantasy basketball and gambling on sports whether this scorekeeper and\/or his family and friends bet on Jaren Jackson to win the defensive player of the year award at super long odds and as a result has a tremendous financial incentive to juice and fake a player's 2 most valuable defensive statistics- BLOCKS and STEALS, which are also the easiest to fudge #s on because it is often most difficult to definitively label steals and blocks without slow motion on at least some of the plays in question. \n\nI and all NBA fans would appreciate a thorough investigation into this matter.\u00a0 It is important to have 100% integrity in statistics not only for things such as fantasy sports, sportsbetting, futures wagers, but even more importantly to ENSURE THE INTEGRITY OF THE GAME FOR ALL.\u00a0 This is mandatory to be able to compare players' statistics versus other players now in the league fairly as well as across seasons and know the numbers are accurate, correct, and not unfairly manipulated by home arena scorekeepers. \n\nI decided to watch just a few of the Grizzlies' recent games and immediately started noticing a pattern: Plays at FedEx arena in Memphis constantly being scored wrongly to gift Jackson extra steals and blocks which never occurred.\u00a0 Simply put, if a shot does not hit the rim or it otherwise looks bad somehow, and Jaren Jackson is either contesting the shot or close to the action, he is credited with FRAUDULENT blocks repeatedly.\u00a0 Sometimes this is achieved by taking away the stat from his teammates. Other times, an opposing player simply loses the ball or shoots a contested shot way off target, but Jackson nevertheless is credited with steals & blocks that never occurred in both instances.\u00a0 Also, when he deflects a ball and it goes to a teammate he is credited with the steal.\u00a0 When his teammate deflects the ball and it goes to him he is STILL credited with the steal IN MEMPHIS.\u00a0 When he tips or deflects a ball, but never gains possession nor do the Grizzlies, he is still awarded a steal. \n\nThe following is just a very small % of questionable or outright WRONG steals and blocks given to Jackson: \n\nExample #1 New Orleans Pelicans @ Memphis Grizzlies \nSaturday 12\/31\n7mins, 21 sec remaining in the 2nd quarter\nZion drives to the basket, NEVER shoots the ball, and loses it. \"Williamson in a crowd, ball pops free, picked up by Tyus Jones, turnover number 9 by the pelicans\" announcers say.\u00a0 Scorekeeper in Memphis graded the play as Jaren Jackson Jr. blocks Zion Williamson's 3-foot driving layup \n\nExample #2 Utah Jazz @ Memphis Grizzlies \nSunday 1\/8 \n10:09 remaining in the 1st quarter\nJordan Clarkson throws a bad pass directly to Desmond Bane and Jaren Jackson for some odd reason is credited with the steal.\u00a0 Bane actually steals the ball. \n\nExample #3 Utah Jazz @ Memphis Grizzlies\nSunday 1\/8\n1:46 remaining in the 4th quarter\nKelly Olynyk loses the ball while being defended by Xavier Tillman.\u00a0 The ball then bounces off Tillman and Jaren Jackson before being picked up by Tillman. The steal should be credited to Tillman.\u00a0 Memphis scorekeeper grades the play as Jaren Jackson Jr. steals \n\nExample #4 Phoenix Suns @ Memphis Grizzlies\nMonday 1\/16\n7:02 remaining in the 4th quarter\nBrandon Clarke blocks Saban Lee's layup, but the Memphis scorekeeper instantly gives the block to nearby Jaren Jackson Jr. \n\nExample #5 Cleveland Cavaliers @ Memphis Grizzlies\nWednesday 1\/18\n11:48 remaining in the 2nd quarter\nLamar Stevens, who Jaren Jackson helps on, loses the ball and Desmond Bane picks it up and gains possession.\u00a0 The Memphis scorekeeper gave steal to Jaren Jackson. \n\nExample #6 Detroit Pistons @ Memphis Grizzlies\nFriday, December 9th\n39 seconds remaining in the 2nd quarter\nJackson deflects a pass and never gains possession, saved back to Detroit player. Memphis scorekeeper gives a steal to Jackson. \n\nExample #7 Oklahoma City Thunder @ Memphis Grizzlies\nWednesday, December 7th\n10:38 4th quarter\nJackson saves out of bounds ball directly to Thunder player underneath basket for quick score, but gets credited with a steal. \n\nThank you very much for reading this.\u00a0 I would appreciate well thought out responses, a good discussion, and also advice on how someone in charge at the NBA can investigate these plays as well as others from Grizzlies games, and the dishonest Memphis scorekeeper.\u00a0 Also, can obviously fraudulent statistics be deleted, corrected & reversed weeks\/months later?","score":66976,"num_comments":4101,"author":"AdMassive6666","created_utc":1674898943000,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nba\/comments\/10nbau4\/memphis_grizzlies_scorekeeper_posting_fraudulent\/","upvote_ratio":0.89,"over_18":false,"edited":false,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false}

{"id":"rpr4vd","title":"[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar] While LeBron James is a necessary and dynamic voice critical of police brutality against the Black community, he needs to be the same necessary and dynamic advocate with vaccines, which could save thousands of Black lives right now.","selftext":"[Source](https:\/\/kareem.substack.com\/p\/dear-lebron-heres-the-covid-19-help)\n\n> LeBron James is not only one of the greatest basketball players ever, he\u2019s committed to being a leader in the African American community in the fight against inequality. But his Thursday Instagram meme showing three cartoon Spider-Men pointing at each other\u2014one labeled \u201ccovid,\u201d one labeled \u201cflu,\u201d one labeled \u201ccold\u201d\u2014with his message: \u201cHelp me out folks\u201d was a blow to his worthy legacy. The meme\u2019s implication is that LeBron doesn\u2019t understand the difference among these three illnesses, even after all the information that\u2019s been presented in the press. Well, since he asked, let me help him out by explaining the difference\u2014and how knowing that difference might save lives, especially in the Black community.\n> \n -----\n> \n> First, let\u2019s put his meme in context. In September, LeBron stated: \u201cI don\u2019t talk about other people and what they should do. We\u2019re talking about individual bodies. We\u2019re not talking about something political or racism or police brutality. I don\u2019t think I personally should get involved in what other people do for their bodies and livelihoods ... I know what I did for me and my family ... But as far as speaking for everybody and their individualities and things they want to do, that\u2019s not my job.\u201d\n> \n> Here\u2019s the first problem with that statement: With 106 million Instagram followers, making such a post is automatically politically impactful because he questions the validity of the efforts to get the country vaccinated. As is evident by some of the comments that cheer LeBron\u2019s post, he\u2019s given support to those not getting vaccinated, which makes the situation for all of worse by postponing our health and economic recovery. The CDC reports that those who are unvaccinated are 9 times more likely to be admitted to the hospital and 14 times more likely to die from COVID than those vaccinated. The number rises to 20 time more likely when compared to someone who\u2019s gotten a booster shot. By posting the uninformed meme, LeBron has encouraged vaccine hesitancy which puts lives and livelihoods at risk.\n> \n> Here\u2019s the second problem with that statement: He says we\u2019re not talking about racism, but we most definitely are. As of December 2020, about 97.9 out of every 100,000 African Americans had died from COVID-19, a third higher than that for Latinos (64.7 per 100,000), and more than double than that for whites (46.6 per 100,000) and Asians (40.4 per 100,000). According to an article on the U.S. National Library of Medicine site, \u201cThe overrepresentation of African Americans among confirmed COVID-19 cases and number of deaths underscores the fact that the coronavirus pandemic, far from being an equalizer, is amplifying or even worsening existing social inequalities tied to race, class, and access to the health care system.\u201d\n> \n\n---- \n\n> A year later, the communities of People of Color are still suffering at a much higher rate than white communities. In November 2021, the CDC stated, \u201cIt has highlighted that health equity is still not a reality as COVID-19 has unequally affected many racial and ethnic minority groups, putting them more at risk of getting sick and dying from COVID-19.\u201d One study in Atlanta showed 79% of Blacks with COVID-19 were hospitalized versus 13% of whites. COVID-19 has resulted in a drop in life expectancy among whites of 1.2 years. Among the Black and Latinx communities it was more than 3 years.\n> \n> For those confident that the Omicron variant may not be as harsh as previous variants, it\u2019s important to realize that, while most might come out of it okay, they can still unwittingly infect others along the way\u2014the elderly, people with compromised immune systems, people with respiratory problems\u2014who could end up hospitalized or dead. Also, almost half of those who recover from initial COVID-19 illness have \u201clong-haul COVID,\u201d with persistent symptoms of brain fog, shortness of breath, fatigue, dizziness, and headaches.\n> \n> For those pointing out that there are \u201cbreakthrough\u201d cases in which the vaccinated contract COVID-19. Yes, but they also have lighter symptoms and are at a much less risk of dying than the unvaccinated. The crucial statistic here is this: 98-99% of Americans dying of COVID-19 are unvaccinated.\n> \n\n-----\n\n> Vaccine hesitancy is higher in the Black community than in any other. While there are certainly justifiable historical reasons for Blacks to be skeptical of the health care system that has routinely marginalized, ignored, and even illegally experimented on them, that is not enough to justify compromising their health and even losing their lives during the current health crisis.\n> \n> To directly address LeBron\u2019s confusion, no one thinks colds and the flu aren\u2019t serious. In the 2019-2020 flu season, 400,000 people were hospitalized and 22,000 people died. In 2020, 385,428 people died of COVID-19, while so far in 2021, 423,558 have died in the U.S., for a total of 808,986 deaths. Experts agree that COVID-19 is at least 10 times more lethal than the flu. As for the common cold, death is extremely rare.\n> \n> However, LeBron, if you\u2019re concerned about the flu, then help promote the flu vaccination. In the 2019-2020 flu season, only 51.8% in the U.S. were vaccinated, well below the 70% that is the target. Worse, the vaccination rate is 20% lower among Blacks than whites and as a result they have the highest hospitalization rate due to flu of any other group. This is due to vaccination hesitancy that your meme promotes.\n> \n> One way to help the Black community to overcome their hesitancy and save lives is for prominent Black celebrities and influencers to continue to encourage everyone to get vaccinated and their boosters. Immunization, whether from vaccines or having had the disease, lessens over time and makes people vulnerable for reinfection.\n> \n> While LeBron is a necessary and dynamic voice critical of police brutality against the Black community, he needs to be the same necessary and dynamic advocate with vaccines, which could save thousands of Black lives right now. The racism is just as real\u2014and just as lethal\u2014in both cases.","score":42983,"num_comments":2846,"author":"GuyCarbonneauGOAT","created_utc":1640622451000,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nba\/comments\/rpr4vd\/kareem_abduljabbar_while_lebron_james_is_a\/","upvote_ratio":0.78,"over_18":false,"edited":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false}

{"id":"joovqq","title":"The Charlotte Hornets have a transgender mascot","selftext":"Hugo the hornet is the mascot for the Charlotte hornets. His Facebook page lists him as male, he has a male name, but he also has a stinger. Only females have stingers as they are modified ovipositors. This means he must have been born a female, and later transitioned to a male before becoming the mascot for the Charlotte Hornets. I suspect this was kept quiet at the time because transgender individuals dealt with even more bigotry back in 1988 when he was introduced, than they do today. The other possibility is that he is a male hornet, and does not actually have a stinger. This makes sense if you look at their record.","score":35626,"num_comments":691,"author":"alteredhead","created_utc":1604603370000,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nba\/comments\/joovqq\/the_charlotte_hornets_have_a_transgender_mascot\/","upvote_ratio":0.86,"over_18":false,"edited":false,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false}

{"id":"xu2f65","title":"Kareem Abdul-Jabbar on Kyrie posting about Alex Jones: \"Kyrie Irving would be dismissed as a comical buffoon if it weren\u2019t for his influence over young people who look up to athletes.\"","selftext":"Full bit on Kyrie here:\n\n> There is some irony in this news item coming right after the previous one about the miseducation of American youth. Because Kyrie Irving\u2019s thought process is an example of what happens when the education system fails.\n\n> Last October, I wrote a piece about Kyrie Irving\u2019s refusal to get vaccinated against COVID-19 (\u201cShould We Just \u2018Leave Kyrie Alone?\u201d) and why this reckless choice was destructive to the country and especially the Black community where he would be an influential role model. The facts proved that accusation to be true. Irving didn\u2019t care. He continued to promote his anti-vax sentiments\u2014regardless of the cost in lives and health to others\u2014proclaiming himself a \u201cmartyr.\u201d Not kidding.\n\n> We might have just left him alone to stew in his own gelatinous ignorance. Rich and famous people get away with saying dumb things all the time because their money isolates them from consequences. They surround themselves with Yes-people whose job is to confirm whatever hare-brained ideas they have. Yes, sir, Mr. Irving, the Earth has never been flatter.\n\n> But now Irving is back and more destructive, insensitive, and just plain silly than before. He decided it would be a good idea to post a 2002 video clip from Infowars founder Alex Jones. Yeah, the guy who has been on trial for denying the Sandy Hook shootings and who previously admitted in open court that he\u2019s a performer and his onscreen persona is just a character (that bilks millions of dollars from unaware viewers). The main gist of the clip is a warning about a cabal of international leaders who are secretly releasing plagues on the world from which they can profit. (Of course, we know who really profits from making this claim.)\n\n> Alex Jones is one of the most despicable human beings alive and to associate with him means you share his stench.\n\n> Kyrie Irving would be dismissed as a comical buffoon if it weren\u2019t for his influence over young people who look up to athletes. When I look at some of the athletes who have used their status to actually improve society\u2014Colin Kaepernick, LeBron James, Muhammad Ali, Bill Russel, Billie Jean King, Arthur Ashe, and more\u2014it becomes clear how much Irving has tarnished the reputations of all athletes who strive to be seen as more than dumb jocks.\n\n> Irving does not seem to have the capacity to change, but we have the capacity to keep fighting against his brand of destructive behavior. One way to do that, beyond shaking our heads and nasty tweets, is to write to his sponsors and tell them to drop Irving\u2014or you will drop them. Nike has likely decided not to renew his contract past this season. But he is still sponsored by Pepsi and 2K Sports. (Don\u2019t feel bad for Irving: his career earnings at the end of the 2022-\u201923 season will be $230 million. That buys a lot of Yes-people.)\n\nhttps:\/\/kareem.substack.com\/p\/kareem-reacts-to-the-news-desantis-6ca","score":33350,"num_comments":1624,"author":"cesga_0218","created_utc":1664751243000,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nba\/comments\/xu2f65\/kareem_abduljabbar_on_kyrie_posting_about_alex\/","upvote_ratio":0.9,"over_18":false,"edited":false,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false}

{"id":"f3to7w","title":"[OC] Charles Barkley's Secret: A Critical Analysis","selftext":" If you have ever had the chance to watch a basketball game on TNT, you might have caught yourself as glued to the half-time show as the actual game. *NBA on TNT* is one of the best sports broadcasts hosted by some of the boldest personalities on TV: Shaquille O\u2019Neil, Ernie Johnson, Kenny Smith, and of course\u2026 Charles Barkley.\u00a0\n\nThere are no subjects off limits and no quarter is given. But there is one topic that never fails to elicit strong consternation from Ernie despite roars of laughter from Shaq\u2014 Charles Barkley\u2019s bit about the Big ol Women\u2122 of San Antonio. If you haven\u2019t seen it, here\u2019s one of the best supercuts to catch you up: \n\n [https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=E7GPuudYY5k](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=E7GPuudYY5k) \n\nAs you can see, Chuck is fascinated with San Antonio\u200a\u2014\u200awell, with the women and churros of San Antonio at least. He brings up the subject so often that simply googling \u201cSan Antonio Women\u201d yields almost exclusively articles and clips of Barkley & Co. discussing the virtues of San Antonio churros, the Big \u2018ol Women\u2122 who eat them, and the city\u2019s curious lack of Victoria\u2019s Secret stores.\n\n \n\n[ google search results for generic query \\\\\"San Antonio Women\\\\\"](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/81yphxq1mwg41.png?width=1288&format=png&auto=webp&s=37f18954312ed009a9e3c4d2d6620d7e15a06900)\n\nFrom his time as a [player](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=nMzdAZ3TjCA), to his current career as a broadcaster, Barkley is infamous for never minding his tongue. When it comes to making Shaq and the production crew keel over with laughter, it\u2019s clear he has no plans to change his humorous tone, no matter how much Ernie scorns him.  \n\n\n***But did you ever wonder\u00a0why\u2026 Why is Chuck so fixated on the Big ol Women*****\u2122** ***of San Antonio and their unique pastry\/ lingerie inclinations?***\n\n  \n***Is there something more behind the man\u2019s obsession?***\n\nSo began my search to understand the enigma that is Charles Wade Barkley\u2026\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# The Research\n\nI started out by attempting to confirm or refute Barkley\u2019s suspicions\u2026\u00a0\n\n* Does San Antonio have a lot of Big ol Women\u2122?\u00a0\n* Is Victoria really a \u201cSecret\u201d in San Antonio?, and\n* How do fried Spanish pastries play into this whole thing?\n\nWell let\u2019s break it down one-by-one\u2026\n\n \n\n**San Antonio\u2019s Big ol Women\u2122**\n\nI compared obesity rates for every NBA city to determine if there is any merit to Chuck\u2019s claim that San Antonio has an abundance of plus-sized ladies\u2026\n\n[ NBA cities ranked by Obesity Rates ](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/9mm0ytabmwg41.png?width=383&format=png&auto=webp&s=6761f072a5ca61b9a1c7d47d1ae4bc3b9c64aee6)\n\nAs it turns out, he is right on point. According to my analysis of a 2018 CDC report, San Antonio is the 4th chunkiest city in the NBA with more than 37% of adults registering as \u201cclinically obese\u201d. And with over half of San Antonians identifying as female, it\u2019s safe to say the city *does* have a lot of *Big ol Women\u2122*.\n\nInteresting side note: San Antonio isn\u2019t just one of the fattest cities in the nation, they also have a distinct love for the rolls (pun intended). Per my research, San Antonio ranks #2 in the country for most google searches for \u201cBBW\u201d, which is of course the porn abbreviation for *Big Beautiful Women*. Not sure the significance of this fact, or how I came upon this information, but thought it was worth mentioning.\n\n[google trend statistics for search term \\\\\"bbw\\\\\"](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/44t42v5dmwg41.png?width=466&format=png&auto=webp&s=5b9e965defdcc0bedd498dea3ee1369f16326141)\n\n *How many of these searches belong to Chuck himself? No small amount, I can assure you.*\n\n \n\n**\u201cWho\u2019s Victoria?\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aSan\u00a0Antonio**\n\nUsing [Victoria\u2019s Secret store locator](https:\/\/www.victoriassecret.com\/store-locator), I compiled the total number of store locations in each NBA city. Then, using 2016 U.S. Census Bureau statistics, I appended the populations for each city and calculated the amount of Victoria\u2019s Secret stores per capita.\n\n[ NBA cities ranked by Victoria's Secret stores per capita ](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/a8l2hdrgmwg41.png?width=658&format=png&auto=webp&s=97e81c43e0ac765ac3237f7df91ba0a1e2708772)\n\nAgain, Chuck\u2019s intuition was spot-on! The city of San Antonio has the 4th fewest number of Victoria\u2019s Secret stores per capita of all NBA cities (bottom 89th percentile).\n\nI guess it\u2019s safe to conclude, Victoria really is a secret in San Antonio.\n\n*The author contacted Victoria\u2019s Secret Public Relations prior to publishing this article but they chose not to comment on this story.*\n\n \n\n**How do fried Spanish pastries play into\u00a0this?**\n\nTremendously, that\u2019s how.\n\nI literally spent over three hours immersed in \u201cchurro data\u201d. Admittedly, one of those hours was a lunchtime run to \u201cAngel\u2019s Churros & Chocolates\u201d in Houston, TX\u200a\u2014\u200ashout out to Maria for hooking it up with the Nutella on the side!\n\nUsing cutting-edge scientific research tools, I determined the number of churro vendors per capita in each NBA city. Okay, I googled that shit. I figured counting Mexican restaurants in general would be super misleading so I quantified specifically the number of churro vendors in each NBA city using the following criteria: Performed the google search \u201c\\[CITY\\] Churros\u201d (e.g., \u201cSan Antonio Churros\u201d) and counted the amount of vendors with *explicit* references to \u201cChurro\u201d in the name. I accepted various spellings and puns (e.g., \u201cxurros\u201d, or \u201cChurroholic\u201d, etc).\n\n[ NBA cities ranked by churro-vendors per capita ](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/9gjixg6kmwg41.png?width=580&format=png&auto=webp&s=e4fe6433feafdaa01a5a827a841ca236988cc978)\n\nWell Mr. Barkley\u2019s hunch was right again\u2026 San Antonio has the 4th most Churro-Vendors per capita in the NBA (top \\~90th percentile). Have to admit, though, I did *not* expect to see Salt Lake City rank so high on this list. Considering the [strip club rankings](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nba\/comments\/dt0ucg\/i_analyzed_james_hardens_performance_in_every_nba\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x), I might actually have to make a trip to the \u2018great white west\u2019\u2026\u00a0\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe have to give credit to Chuck here; he certainly knows his stuff! But for a man who [disavows data science](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=NZf9NFaCQHQ), it begs the question, how does he know so much about the Alamo city?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# The Analysis\n\nWith my suspicions on the rise, I dug deeper into the data. And the more I dug, the more it smelled\u2026 \\*sniff\\* and I love the smell of cinnamon and projection in the morning. So what is Mr. Barkley hiding? Well, I analyzed his career performance in San Antonio to see if there is more to the story.\n\nCharles Barkley has an [impressive resume](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Charles_Barkley): two-time Olympic gold medalist, 11-time NBA All Star, 1993 Most Valuable Player, and an esteemed member of the NBA hall of fame. He went by the intimidating moniker, *Round Mound of Rebound*. He is, indubitably, one of the greatest ballers of all time. But, just like all the greats, he had a weakness\u2026\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\u2018The Biggest\u00a0Loser\u2019**\n\nBetween the years 1983\u20131998, Barkley played 19 games in San Antonio. *He won just 4 of them*. With his career road-win percentage at nearly\u00a0.500, and considering the other damning stats laid out below, his\u00a0.211 win rate in San Antonio falls soundly in the \"*curious\"* column.\n\n* Career Road W\/L Record: 259\u2013276 (.484 win%)\n* San Antonio W\/L Record: 4\u201315 (.211 win%)\n\n \n\n[ W\\\/L split, Career Away vs in San Antonio ](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/hiw4wzawmwg41.png?width=696&format=png&auto=webp&s=49520e597148522c9414d67508b7de45bb8d8eac)\n\nNow I don\u2019t want to mislead you, San Antonio were no schmucks during this period and, obviously, basketball is a team sport. But Barkley carries most of the water: he was a generational talent and the stand-out star on most of his teams (aside from a couple years with a washed up Julius Erving and an aging Moses Malone in Philly and a couple with near-retirement Hakeem in Houston). But the following analysis should help further make my case.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**\u2018My -25%\u00a0Life\u2019**\n\nSan Antonio proved to be a blight on Barkley\u2019s esteemed career. My analysis showed significant declines in almost every statistical category examined:\n\n* **GmSc**\u200a\u2014\u200aAveraged a **-25% variance** in Game Score in SA compared to career avg\n* **ORB**\u200a\u2014\u200aAveraged a -**11% variance** in Offensive Rebounds in SA as compared to career avg\n* **FT%**\u200a\u2014\u200aAveraged a **-9% variance** in FT shooting efficiency in SA as compared to career avg\n* **FG%**\u200a\u2014\u200aAveraged a **-2% variance** in shooting efficiency in SA as compared to career avg\n* **AST**\u200a\u2014\u200aAveraged a **-6% variance** in Assists in SA as compared to career avg\n\nNote: [GmSc](https:\/\/www.basketball-reference.com\/about\/glossary.html) (Game Score) is a John Hollinger-created stat that gives a comprehensive measure of a player\u2019s productivity. Formula: *GmSc=PTS+(0.4\\*FG)\u2013(0.7\\*FGA)\u2013\\[0.4\\*(FTA-FT)\\]+(0.7\\*ORB)+(0.3\\*DRB)+STL+(0.7\\*AST)+(0.7\\*BLK)\u2013(0.4\\*PF)-TOV*\n\nHere\u2019s what the analysis looks like:\n\n[ Barkley performance analysis via heat mapping ](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/bm4bja82nwg41.png?width=1127&format=png&auto=webp&s=e8908dd66fda7cb895c93a1f498644ed734988d1)\n\nYou can see the heat map to the left is covered in red. Red cells indicate *negative* variances, meaning: for that year, Barkley\u2019s average in San Antonio was *below* his Season Average. Of the 112 total data points examined (8 stats x 14 seasons), Barkley under-performed against the season average **62%** of the time.\n\nHeat maps are great but I needed to visualize the data in a way that better depicts the scale of Chuck\u2019s drop in performance. I used a clustered column chart because it gives the best visual representation of relative performance, as you can easily identify the +\/- trends (*Graphs for Dummies: larger\/more frequent lines on BOTTOM = BAD; larger\/more frequent lines on TOP = GOOD*).\u00a0\n\n \n\n[Barkley GmSc Variance in SA vs Season Avg](https:\/\/preview.redd.it\/d7u0gmi4nwg41.png?width=801&format=png&auto=webp&s=2060d12d0604f038bcbb8c7a135b5a0b22ff9816)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Barkley Shooting Eff.

But what do they truly *tell us*?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n#  Conclusion\n\nWell, if you\u2019ve been following along, things should be starting to make sense. A picture has formed\u2026 how could a man who so ardently rebukes data science, know things about San Antonio that only the *data* can tell us?\n\nEvery Great had their weakness. MJ couldn\u2019t stop gambling. Shaq couldn\u2019t hit free throws. Magic couldn\u2019t keep it in his pants. Kobe never saw a shot he didn\u2019t like. LeBron, hairline.\n\nFor Charles Barkley, it was an entire city. The plus-sized women of San Antonio and their delectable Spanish pastries were the Round Mound\u2019s kryptonite. And it appears he never got over it. A career of indulgence in the Alamo City has left him bitter with regret.\n\nThe Chuckster has used his platform on TNT to\u200a\u2014\u200anot very credibly\u200a\u2014\u200adisguise his own predilections for the amenities of San Antonio. Without stretching the facts too far, we can paint a vivid picture of Barkley\u2019s own struggle. Imagine: a perpetual Big-and-Tall man since roughly the age of 12 (guessing) and a basketball phenom would have become accustomed to night-after-night by himself with nothing but his appetite and a sense that\u200a\u2014\u200athanks to his coaches\u200a\u2014\u200ahe *deserved* to be rewarded. That he was a *good boy*. Another city, another game, another 4-star hotel room to himself (another sold-out show, as it were).\n\nThe excitement of seeing San Antonio on the schedule brings tears to the man\u2019s eyes. He knows what awaits him and purposefully forgets what happened before\u2026\n\n>*Barkley, awaken by the morning sun\u2019s blistering reflection off the San Antonio R\u0336i\u0336v\u0336e\u0336r\u0336* [*Creek*](https:\/\/www.mysanantonio.com\/news\/local\/article\/San-Antonio-River-Authority-fires-back-at-Charles-5465978.php)*, sees the debris and refuse from an all-night binge. He did it again. Churro wrappers crinkling beneath his weight, cinnamon sugar coating the corners of his mouth and fingers alike, and a familiar wave of anxiety that tends to come after relapse. As his memory from the prior night returns, he glances around the room with a vain hopefulness that he did not \u2018fall\u2019 alone. He was relieved to learn that, in fact, he was not alone in the previous night\u2019s debasement. Positioned heavily\u200a\u2014\u200anay, crushingly\u200a\u2014\u200aon the duvet is a Big ol Woman\u2122 sporting a handsome pair of* [*bloomers*](https:\/\/www.ebay.com\/itm\/Lolita-Women-Sweet-Bloomers-Underwear-Pumpkin-Shorts-Safety-Pants-Cosplay-\/182538951060)*. Her voluminous mass reassuring him\u200a\u2014\u200ano, beckoning him\u200a\u2014\u200ato forgive himself for his indiscretions. It wasn\u2019t just him after all. But he knew exactly what he had done. In a rush to forget, he licked the crusted cinnamon from his lips, quietly donned his game day attire and snuck out to meet his teammates in the lobby.*  \n>  \n>  \n*But his mind would never leave that hotel room.*\n\nIt is through painting this portrait of a man both conflicted and passionate (aren\u2019t we all) that we can better understand the system of associations that have led Barkley to betray his own naked psychology for all the world to jeer at. And yet, can we blame the man? Are we not all, on some level, looking for someone to share in our appetites? Whether it be for the occasional night of plus-size women and churros, or too many designer handbags; everyone has a vice. Unfortunately, from years of shame for letting down his teammates and coaches, Chuck has betrayed the very thing that he loves.\u00a0\n\nThat\u2019s why I\u2019m here to tell him, myself: **Stop Projecting, Mr. Barkley.**\n\n**In 2020, the decade of proclaimed** **ass-eating, there is** ***no*** **shame.\u00a0It\u2019s** ***okay*** **to stan for Big ol Women\u2122.

{"id":"6cbgx1","title":"Wilt Chamberlain secretly dominated professional basketball at age 16 under a false identity. Scoring as much as 46 points against pros in the Eastern U.S. with a team record of 36-1. By age 17 he was averaging 40.5ppg. This is the first time I'm sharing this research:","selftext":"[Wilt Chamberlain Dominating Professional basketball leagues at age 16, and 17](http:\/\/imgur.com\/vNZZsm5)\n\nCalculated averages for 17 year old Wilt as a Quakertown Fay:\n\n* 40.5ppg in 9 regular season games (according to one of the articles)\n\n* 74ppg in 6 playoff games (according to the math... not sure it's even possible but who knows)\n\n* 53.9ppg in 15 total games (according to a Quakertown book)\n\n* Worth mentioning he won the MVP award in that league\n\n[Image 2](http:\/\/imgur.com\/NmbZnL8.jpg)\n\n[Image 3](http:\/\/imgur.com\/2nhBTqC.jpg)\n\n[Image 4](http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/BBnYsYc.jpg)\n\n[Image 5](http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/ecuUBnC.png)\n\nWilt Chamberlain, or as he was first known, \"George Marcus\", secretly dominated professional basketball under that assumed identity at age 16 for the Pittsburgh Raiders. Even as a kid against 6-11 men his own size playing professionally (such as former Harlem Globetrotters!) he averaged 53.9ppg by age 17. I found game recaps of multiple 46 point performances for the Quakertown Fay's at age 17, and at least one 44 point game even at age 16 for the Pittsburgh Raiders.\n\nThis is not only not often talked about, it's NEVER talked about. I've seen only a few references to his professional career that predated college basketball. When I researched this I found out it got him into potential trouble with the NCAA and so it was kept hushed and perhaps left to be forgotten.\n\n*EDIT* Allow me to plug one other researcher who I've come to learn first shared the photographs of Wilt playing for the Fay's a few years ago. I found him on Twitter, and here's a link to a fascinating video he produced!\n\nhttps:\/\/twitter.com\/storyrd\n\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=un5HPRWW4Yk\n\n*EDIT*\n\nIMPORTANT UPDATE - According to a Quakertown book (researched by [bardown](http:\/\/www.bardown.com\/under-a-fake-identity-wilt-chamberlain-dominated-pro-basketball-when-he-was-16-and-17-1.757398) staff) Wilt actually averaged 53.9ppg in all 15 games as a Quakertown Fay! He \"only\" averaged 40.5ppg in 9 regular season games but with playoffs combined his 15 game average shoots up to 53.9ppg! This means 74ppg in the 6 playoff games as a Fay. I'm not sure if this is even possible so please take with a grain of salt. Though he did score 90 points in high school and 100 in the NBA including 5 other 70+ point games so who knows. This being against former pros his own size too including 6-11 former Globetrotter Andy Maddox!","score":31000,"num_comments":1477,"author":"dantheman9758","created_utc":1495300331000,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nba\/comments\/6cbgx1\/wilt_chamberlain_secretly_dominated_professional\/","upvote_ratio":0.92,"over_18":false,"edited":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false}

About Booker going from the bottom to the top, proving the doubters wrong, and trying to become legendary for Kobe. They could've focused Cam Payne going from out of the league to 6th man for a .700 team or hyped up how the bubble changed our culture.\n\nThey could've spoken about how James Jones came out of nowhere to become an excellent GM or how Monty is proving his old doubters wrong. They could've talked about Ayton's humility and huge improvement throughout the year or Bridges being a winning role player everywhere on the court\n\nInstead of all that, they just talked about CP3 because that's all they knew. And rather than doubting a team for their improbable run, they could've hyped it up more. \n\nThey just wanted to focus on big names and popular teams and were unprepared that others might have success so now a ton are either scrambling or complaining about the matchups and how \"they're bad for the NBA.\"\n\nWhy does the NBA media do this?

{"id":"13potkg","title":"ESPN, if you\u2019re reading this: please, we\u2019re begging you, no more Mark Jackson next year","selftext":"After watching ESPN\u2019s coverage of the Western Conference Finals, I seriously don\u2019t understand how Mark Jackson is the best that ESPN can do as far as in-game analysts go.\n\nJackson\u2019s commentary is, at best, perfunctory.  He offers the same type of analysis as the [baseball scouts in Moneyball](https:\/\/m.youtube.com\/watch?v=DtumWOsgFXc&pp=ygUQTW9uZXliYWxsIHNjb3V0cw%3D%3D), just regurgitating platitudes about how so-and-so is a \u201cwinning player\u201d or the \u201ctype of guy you want on your team.\u201d  When he does go out on a limb and offer a real opinion, I find that the opinion he offers is usually stupid.  For example, in last night\u2019s game, with Denver up two late, the Lakers had a side-out with 3.2 on the shot clock.  Jackson\u2019s analysis?  \u201cIf you\u2019re Denver, you want to make sure LeBron doesn\u2019t get a step-back three.\u201d  Motherfucker, that\u2019s the exact shot Denver had been forcing LeBron to beat them with all series, and he was shooting it poorly all series.  Naturally, Denver, a team led by a man who has been able to retain his employment as an NBA coach, walled up inside and prevented them from getting an easy two to tie it up.  \n\nJackson also is one of those commentators who clearly comes in with an agenda of what he expects (some would say \u201cwants\u201d) to happen.  He clearly hadn\u2019t prepared for the possibility of Denver dominating the series, and when they won last night he basically fell silent for the entire post-game show.  \n\nLook at the comments in almost any ESPN-covered game on here, and you\u2019ll find countless examples of fans complaining about the commentary and begging for more games to be on TNT to get a respite from Jackson. It seems like fans are pretty universally on board with wanting a change.  Jackson isn\u2019t even a very big name like Reggie Miller or Grant Hill (both of whom are far better analysts than he is), so I don\u2019t understand the appeal - I can\u2019t imagine any casual fans are particularly curious what Mark Jackson\u2019s thought are on a given game. \n\nThat\u2019s not even mentioning that he\u2019s apparently [so bad at the non-commentary aspects of his job](http:\/\/amp.awfulannouncing.com\/nba\/after-mvp-voting-fiasco-is-mark-jackson-still-a-viable-head-coaching-candidate-in-the-nba.html) that he accidentally voted for what he thought was All-NBA twice instead of submitting his desired MVP ballot. \n\nAND, on top of all that, there\u2019s Mark Jackson\u2019s alleged [history of homophobia](https:\/\/www.knbr.com\/2022\/05\/10\/mark-jackson-reportedly-used-homophobic-slurs-said-rick-welts-and-jason-collins-were-going-to-hell-as-warriors-head-coach\/).  Now, I know that corporate \u201callyship\u201d is all fake and performative.  I also am not one of those people who thinks that mere allegations of bad behavior or beliefs should immediately get you fired from your job.  But when I\u2019m watching the games and I know that the commentator is a probable homophobe ON TOP OF being terrible at his job, it makes it extra frustrating that they just keep bringing him back.\n\nSo, why does ESPN insist on keeping him on? He\u2019s not that big of a name, has a dubious personal history, and - most importantly - he doesn\u2019t produce a good end product.  \n\nWhat is he offering that another commentator can\u2019t?","score":28257,"num_comments":2214,"author":"HereToTalkMovies2","created_utc":1684849089000,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nba\/comments\/13potkg\/espn_if_youre_reading_this_please_were_begging\/","upvote_ratio":0.92,"over_18":false,"edited":false,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false}

{"id":"o427ei","title":"15 years ago, Giannis was homeless in Greece, was in constant fear of deportation and racist retaliation, and didn\u2019t play basketball. Against all odds, Giannis has already carved out a better life for his family. Now, after scoring 40 points in game 7, he has a chance at basketball immortality","selftext":"Giannis is the son of Nigerian immigrants that came to Greece in search of a better life. In reality, their life would be exceedingly difficult; they were homeless, they struggled to find work, and they were constantly in fear of deportation as they were unable to acquire full Greek citizenship. They had four children to feed, and often there was not enough to go around. In the worst of times, Giannis and his family would go two or three days without eating.\n\nAt 13, Giannis, rail-thin and with no basketball experience, was discovered by a (previously) failed basketball scout. After the scout promised to secure Giannis\u2019 parents with employment, Giannis began playing for a local club and improving his skills. \n\nEven in this time, Giannis\u2019 family did not have resources, and it was people like cafe owner Giannis Tzikas, who used to give the family sandwiches for free, that kept them afloat. In the words of Tzikas, some people asked, \u201cwhy are you feeding the black kids\u201d, but this only made him more determined to help. \n\nBy 2012, Giannis had somehow managed to become an exciting prospect in Greece\u2019s basketball second division, which initially was too obscure of a location to be noticed by many NBA scouts. However, he was noticed by Basket Zaragoza in Spain, who offered him 400,000 euros a year to play for them. Giannis was indescribably excited, saying \u201cI\u2019ll bring my family along with me and I\u2019ll buy a car\u201d.\n\nShortly afterwards, Giannis began to be hyped up by NBA scouts; he was the 2013 draft\u2019s most exciting unknown. With the 15th pick, the Bucks took a chance on him, and the rest is history. \n\nIn Giannis\u2019 rookie season, then teammate Brandon Knight described Giannis regularly carrying six or seven boxes of free food home from the players lounge. When Caron Butler casually threw away a pair of shoes, Giannis, who had grown up sharing one pair with now teammate Thanasis, pulled them out of the garbage, shocked that someone would just throw away such good shoes. \n\nEven now, after signing the biggest contract in league history, Giannis has not forgotten his roots. He regularly gives his money and his time to help people in Milwaukee and in Greece, and has never forgotten to give back in spreading kindness and joy. \n\nWinning a championship in a market that doesn\u2019t attract superstars is a difficult feat, but Giannis\u2019 story shows that he has already done the hard part. Back in 2014, the fresh-faced, 195 pound, 19-year-old Giannis was asked, \u201cSo you got a job, a place to live, what\u2019s next\u201d? Giannis responded, somewhat jokingly, \u201cNothing. Just win a ring now\u201d. After accomplishing everything else, this year might just be his chance.","score":26031,"num_comments":1483,"author":"bonziwellsayo","created_utc":1624182878000,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nba\/comments\/o427ei\/15_years_ago_giannis_was_homeless_in_greece_was\/","upvote_ratio":0.91,"over_18":false,"edited":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false}

I\u2019m having fun.\u201d","selftext":"[Source](https:\/\/www.si.com\/nba\/2021\/09\/07\/paul-pierce-celtics-hall-of-fame-daily-cover)\n\n>Let\u2019s start here: Paul Pierce isn\u2019t sorry.\n\n>Not for the video, that minutes-long clip that made the rounds on social media, the one that cost Pierce his job at ESPN. Honestly, Pierce didn\u2019t even know he made a video. Here\u2019s what happened: In April, Pierce was playing poker at a friend\u2019s house in Los Angeles. There was drinking. And smoking. And strippers. And after a little too much drinking and smoking, Pierce decided to start an Instagram Live and, well, show off the strippers. He went on for a few minutes, riffing, he thought, for a couple hundred people. When he finished, he deleted it. **He didn\u2019t know IG Lives can be recorded (they can) and reposted (it was). Pierce went home that night thinking no one noticed. He woke up the next day and discovered everyone had.**\n\n>Still . . . sorry? \u201cFor what?\u201d asks Pierce. It\u2019s early July, and Pierce is reclining in a straight-backed chair at The Spot, a hookah lounge tucked into a strip mall in Encino, Calif. Around him, clusters of 20- and 30-somethings, many on laptops huddled over glowing screens, oblivious to the presence of basketball royalty. Hours earlier, Pierce was at home, a tailor dispatched by the Basketball Hall of Fame taking measurements for a suit to fit Pierce\u2019s 6\u20197\u201d frame. \u201cI haven\u2019t bought a new suit since I retired,\u201d says Pierce. But he needed something to wear in September for his enshrinement in Springfield, Mass., 90 miles from where he spent the bulk of his 19-year NBA career.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n>ESPN didn\u2019t ask for an apology. The relationship between Pierce and the network had become strained over the past two years. Pierce hated the travel. Network executives didn\u2019t think he was working hard enough. The video, industry sources told Sports Illustrated, was the last straw. \u201cI was done with them, anyway,\u201d says Pierce between pulls of lemon mint. **\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a great fit. There\u2019s a lot of stuff over there that you can\u2019t say. And you have to talk about LeBron all the time.\u201d**\n\n>Pierce\u2019s longtime agent, Jeff Schwartz, suggested Pierce apologize anyway. Schwartz worried that the video might influence Hall voters. Pierce didn\u2019t. \u201cCome on, I didn\u2019t do anything illegal,\u201d says Pierce. \u201cThese motherf-----s in the Hall of Fame, some did [cocaine], f---ing battery. What the f--- did I do? I was just having a good time. All the people coming after me, half you motherf-----s do the same s---. You\u2019re just hiding it. And you all are married while you\u2019re doing it. I\u2019m divorced. I\u2019m retired. I\u2019m having fun.\u201d And if Hall voters had held it against him? \u201cListen,\u201d says Pierce, \u201cif I didn\u2019t make it with this class, it would be the biggest stiff job in Hall of Fame history.\u201d\n\n>Schwartz suggested Pierce speak to Jerry Colangelo, the longtime NBA and USA Basketball exec who doubled as Hall chairman. Pierce agreed. In May, Pierce was in Springfield for former teammate Kevin Garnett\u2019s induction. At a dinner, he approached Colangelo. Pierce repeated: He didn\u2019t think he did anything wrong. \u201cWhat happened has nothing to do with what I did on the court,\u201d says Pierce.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n>Pierce has ideas. He\u2019s collaborating with Garnett on a few. The two are planning on launching a podcast. Pierce wants to do a show that follows the two of them traveling the world. \u201cJust doing all the s--- we couldn\u2019t do when we played,\u201d says Pierce. For example? \u201cSkydiving,\u201d says Pierce. \u201cMaybe a bull run in Spain. Get motorcycles and travel around. Experience different cultures, different foods.

{"id":"4e8ikq","title":"How my NBA experience turned into a nightmare thanks to StubHub - They denied my chance to see the final ever game at Sleep Train Arena last night by selling me invalid tickets.","selftext":"**4\/11 - Here is an update since I don't think it is right to not give StubHub the positive publicity as well when they have reached out and offered to make it up to me.**\n___________________________________\n\nStubHub has reached out to me and advised me that, in keeping with their Buyer Guarantee of offering equal or better seats, they will get me tickets to the home opener next year.\n\nThe rep was extremely professional and apologetic for the situation. I told him they really should provide some kind of safeguards for buyers. He assured me that they aggressively go after any sellers who break their rules.\nI'd have rather got in to the final game, but I am happy with the outcome.\n__________________________________\n\n\n\n**TL:DR \u2013 StubHub sold my wife and I invalid tickets to the final game ever at Sleep Train Arena (ARCO Arena) \u2013 they did not notify me the tickets were bad, I found out when we got denied by the scanner at the door.  Then they kept me on hold for over 40 minutes outside the venue.  I missed the game and it could happen to you.**\n_______________\n\nLet me preface this by saying I do not blame the Kings or NBA for this situation, however I do think that they need to be aware of what one of their major resellers is doing to their fans.\n\nI am a Sacramento Kings fan - through thick and thin.  I scream about hating them, complain, and bemoan our lack of defense, lack of wins, lack of\u2026 everything.  We don\u2019t have much.  We haven\u2019t been to the playoffs in 10 years \u2013 the second longest drought in the NBA (behind the Wolves who I guarantee break that streak soon).  We have a superstar who teases us with his brilliance and then punishes us with his attitude and demeanor.  We went through an absolute nightmare of an ownership that tried not once, not twice, but three times to steal our team and take them to another city.  We just celebrated breaking thirty wins for the first time in nine years.  Yet I love the team to the core.\n\nI\u2019ve watched this team since I was a kid.  In the fourth grade, I had a Kings ruler with pictures of Danny Ainge, Wayman Tisdale, and Kenny Smith.  I had, and still have, only seen NBA games in a structure that has all of the sex appeal of a giant flat office building \u2013 Sleep Train Arena (it will always be ARCO to me).  \n\nThe entire basketball nation probably knows the plight of our dilapidated arena \u2013 tarps falling from the ceiling, leaks when it rains, toilets that don\u2019t work.  Yet we Kings fans love the place.  We always have.  It\u2019s the only real arena we have ever had \u2013 we don\u2019t have any other major league sports in our city and this place is just cozy and fits us.  \n\nIt is the perfect arena for a bunch of rabid fans in a city that Phil Jackson infamously called a \u201ccow town\u201d \u2013 unwittingly unleashing the birth of the very loud Kings cowbells.\n\nAfter all of the disasters of the previous ownership group, we finally were blessed by a man willing to save our team \u2013 Vivek Ranadive.  While we can argue his basketball knowledge and his hands on approach to basketball operations, we cannot argue that he saved the Sacramento Kings and ponied up a lot of money to build us a brand new arena in downtown Sacramento.\n\nWith that very arena scheduled to open this October, many of us Kings fans circled April 9, 2016 on our calendar; the final game at the \u201cold barn\u201d after 28 years.\n\nI was one of those people.  I frequently purchase my tickets from a variety of sources \u2013 Kings.com, eBay, StubHub, Craigslist, etc.  Where ever the best deal lies.  Some are obviously more risky than others \u2013 Craigslist comes to mind.  \n\nI would not fret about buying tickets from StubHub \u2013 I\u2019ve done it before plenty of times.  I hear their commercials all of the time on the radio.  I had no reason to believe that there was any risk buying tickets from their website.\n\nUnfortunately, I found out that I was completely wrong last night.\n \nYesterday, I bought tickets to the final game at Sleep Train with a scheduled tip off against the OKC Thunder at 7:30 pm.  I looked through StubHub and found a great dead for two tickets for my wife and I in Row H of the lower bowl.  The total price was $356.00 \u2013 expensive for a meaningless basketball game, but not for a once-in-a-lifetime event.  \n\nThe Kings were going to do it up big; tons of free giveaways, meet and greets with former players that spanned the entire Sacramento era, the opportunity to go out on the court and shoot a free throw and take pictures \u2013 it was going to be an amazing close to our shabby, but loved, arena.\n\nI [purchased the tickets a little after 5:00 pm yesterday from StubHub](https:\/\/imgur.com\/COW0Khe).  At 5:22 pm, I received my email confirmation with the tickets.  I immediately took [screenshots](http:\/\/imgur.com\/22fIc9n) of [both tickets](https:\/\/imgur.com\/gvpW9B0) to scan at the door on my phone.  My wife and I got ready and we were on our way to drive the 30 or so miles to the arena.\n\nWe arrived at approximately 7:00 pm and by this point could see all of the news trucks, concession stands, and hear the music playing.  We were getting excited.  The parking lot was as full as I\u2019ve ever seen it.\n\nWe made our way past the security check point and walked up to the self-scanner at the door where I pulled up the screenshots of my tickets.  I scanned the first one at the turnstyle:  REFUND flashed on the screen.  I stood there for a second thinking maybe it didn\u2019t register so I tried again.  REFUND.\n\nAt this point, people were piling up behind me so I stepped aside feeling a little embarrassed \u2013 like I was some scammer or didn\u2019t know how to use the scanner.  This was where I felt my first pang of panic.  \n\nI pulled up the second ticket and slid back in line to try again.  REFUND.  I flagged down a door attendant who tried his hand scanner on both tickets: REFUND, REFUND.  It was 7:05 pm and I was in full on panic mode now.  \n\nThe door attendant advised me to go to the box office so we tore off in that direction. I desperately did not want to miss the last ever player introductions at this arena.  Inside the box office, I was sympathetically told by the attendant, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, this is a StubHub problem and we can\u2019t help you \u2013 you need to call them but they\u2019re very good at refunds.\u201d\n\nREFUND.  There\u2019s that word again.  \n\nI don\u2019t want a refund \u2013 I want to see this game!  And time is tick, tick, ticking away.  I grab my phone and literally type StubHub into google as fast as my fingers will let me.  I find the number and call.  After the automated message, the voice tells me the first thing I was dreading to hear, \u201call of our representatives are assisting other callers \u2013 we will be with you shortly.\u201d\n\nI am basically beside myself by now \u2013 I am down to about 15 minutes to tip off and I have no way through the door.  At 7:25pm, while still on hold, I got desperate and went back to the box office.  I asked the representative what the cheapest tickets were just to get in the building.  He tells me $160.00 each for nosebleed upper bowl tickets \u2013 plus fees.  \n\nI can\u2019t believe what I am hearing.  I still don\u2019t know the status of my StubHub tickets so now I am faced with the choice of buying these tickets in front of me for more than the lower bowl tickets that I should already have in my possession or continuing to wait on hold.\n\nI don\u2019t know if I am getting a refund or not for the StubHub tickets, since no one will answer the phone, and am afraid of buying four tickets.  The box office rep says to me, \u201cman, I\u2019m so sorry \u2013 we\u2019ve been seeing this all night from StubHub.\u201d\n\n7:25 pm, 7:30 pm, 7:40 pm, 7:45 pm\n\nBy 7:45 pm, I came to the realization that I was not going to see this game.  My wife and I started the most depressing, dejected walk back to our car imaginable.  About halfway there, the StubHub rep finally came on the line \u2013 after 40+ minutes on hold.  I calmly (as possible) explained my situation to him and asked him exactly what had happened.\n\nHe was unable to explain why my tickets would not work.  I asked him point blank, \u201cDid the guy who sold me these tickets also sell them to someone else.\u201d  He would not answer, just saying that sometimes there are issues with the tickets.  I kept pressing him, asking him why I was not notified that my tickets would not work before I got to the door.  At least then I would have had an opportunity to get different ones.  [The only email I received at that point was my confirmation](https:\/\/imgur.com\/si3xBbk).  He told me that they do not monitor the transactions so if there is an issue, you will not know until you get denied at the door.\n\nI couldn\u2019t believe that I was not getting an answer as to why my tickets would not work.  I explained to him that this was not just any game \u2013 this is a one-time event.  I could tell that he was starting to understand the gravity of my situation.  I kept pushing him about the seller and how this happened.  That\u2019s when he dropped the bomb on me.\n\nHe said, and I quote, **\u201cI probably shouldn\u2019t tell you this, but the seller you bought these tickets from is already under investigation for selling bad tickets.\u201d**\n\nSo there it is \u2013 StubHub knew that this guy is selling bad tickets on their site.  Or at the very least, he is selling the same tickets to multiple people.  The rep told me that he would be investigated which mean absolutely nothing to me standing in the parking lot.  \n\nHe told me he would issue a refund for the price of the tickets and offered me 20% off of my next purchase.  It wasn\u2019t then, and it\u2019s not now, about the money.  We missed something that we had our heart set on.\n\nWe went to a nearby restaurant and watched the game on TV which honestly felt more painful.  It was basically everything we knew it would be; a great halftime show featuring the past players, sentimental videos, the roar of the sell-out crowd as the game came down to the final shot \u2013 with the Kings winning it with 1 second on the clock.  But it wasn\u2019t about the game on the court, it was about the atmosphere in the building.  And we missed it.\n\nThe final kick in the teeth came on the drive home as I listened to the post-game on AM radio.  During a commercial break there was a StubHub ad talking about their \u201cguarantee\u201d to get you in the game.  I couldn\u2019t believe it.  \n\nAs soon as I got home, I fired off an email to StubHub explaining what happened [PART 1](https:\/\/imgur.com\/CsPS7id) and [PART 2](https:\/\/imgur.com\/xhxoupa).  This morning, [I got the response which was basically a form letter](https:\/\/imgur.com\/05E42wK) with some things changed in it.  They ask me to call them back so that they can further investigate.  I called them and the rep I spoke to had no idea why I was calling in, saying, \u201coh they already are looking into the seller.  They probably just wanted you to call to verify you received your refund.\u201d  I knew I got my refund last night!  \n\nI asked him if he at least saw the 20% discount on my account for my next purchase and he said, \u201cNo I don\u2019t see it but I will make sure I add it right now.  It\u2019s actually a 20% credit based on the purchase price of the tickets you already bought.\u201d  At this point, whatever.  So he tells me based on the price of $356.00, my credit on my account will be $71.20.  Not nearly what I think I should get for what I missed but I know I\u2019m not going to get anywhere with this guy.  He thanks me for using StubHub (!) and the call ends.\n\nA couple of minutes later, [an email comes through showing the credit issued to my account](https:\/\/imgur.com\/Wjryil1).  $17.80.  Only missed the mark by $53.   At this point, I am at a loss for words.  \n\nI have sent off yet another email re-explaining everything and asking the questions:\n\n* Why does the seller retain control over tickets that he sold and [received money for](https:\/\/imgur.com\/AlpkvTh)?\n\n* Why does StubHub not warn it\u2019s buyers that you will not make it in to your event if the seller chooses to take his tickets back and resell them to someone else?\n\n* Why was I never advised before I made it to the gate that I was not going to get in?  Had I been advised with enough time, I could have received my refund and still bought other tickets.  By the time I found out I wasn\u2019t getting in and then waited on hold for 40 minutes, I missed my chance to get in.\n\n- Why was the offer of equal or better seats never given to me at the time?  I would have been mad at missing the first quarter, but at least I would have seen the final three quarters.\n\n* Why is there not some sort of seller feedback system to warn buyers of fraudulent sellers similar to eBay?  By their own representative\u2019s admission, this seller was known to StubHub to be a potentially fraudulent seller.  Had I known this guy had issues, I obviously would have avoided the listing.\n\nHere is StubHub\u2019s guarantee [straight from their website](http:\/\/www.stubhub.com\/fanprotect-update\/):\n\n**Summary of StubHub guarantee to Buyers:**\n\n* *You will get your tickets in time for the event*\n\n* *Your tickets will be valid for entry*\n\n* *Your tickets will be the same as those you ordered*\n\n*If any of these things do not occur and you comply with applicable policies and timelines, we will find you comparable or better tickets to the event, or offer you a refund or FanCode for future purchase*\n\n\nI was never, at any point last night, offered comparable or better tickets.  Even though at that point, I would have been mad as I had already missed the first quarter.\n\n\nI apologize for the exceptionally long post.  I want to warn people about StubHub and tell everyone that this company is no better than buying from some stranger on Craigslist.  I hope this gains some traction so that no one else has to go through something as bad as this.","score":24926,"num_comments":1345,"author":"rattlemebones","created_utc":1460336494000,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nba\/comments\/4e8ikq\/how_my_nba_experience_turned_into_a_nightmare\/","upvote_ratio":0.88,"over_18":false,"edited":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false}

{"id":"yl90o9","title":"Kareem's take on Kyrie: \"Honestly, there\u2019s little hope that he will change because he\u2019s insulated by fame and money and surrounded by yes-people. There is no motivation to learn how to distinguish propaganda from facts. All that\u2019s left is for the world to decide how it should respond to him.\"","selftext":">My Take: I couldn\u2019t be prouder of Shaq, Charles, and Reggie for their bold and straightforward comments. They are at the forefront of Black athletes that are condemning the recent antisemitic social media posts by Kyrie Irving and Ye (Kanye West). It\u2019s a genuine \u201cI am Spartacus\u201d moment.\n\n>The NBA Players Association also released a statement on Nov. 1: \u201cAnti-Semitism has no place in our society. The NBPA is focused on creating an environment where everyone is accepted. We are committed to helping players fully understand that certain words can lead to hateful ideologies being spread We will continue to work on identifying and combatting all hate speech wherever it arises.\u201d\n\n>Yet, Irving has been defiant about his postings. You can read his long, rambling, at times contradictory defense here. Mostly he reveals his lack of awareness of how history works. It\u2019s not an all-you-can-eat buffet from which you can pluck just the dishes you like without any understanding of the context.\n\n>His inability to understand why his posts are news can be seen in this statement: \u201cThere\u2019s things being posted every day. I\u2019m no different from the next human being, so don\u2019t treat me any different. You guys come in here and make up this powerful influence that I have (and say) you cannot post that. Why not? Why not?\u201d If he really thinks someone with millions of followers spouting hate speech is the same as Jim in accounting posting on Facebook, then he really is out of step with reality.\n\n>The Nets finally forced Irving to acknowledge the damage he\u2019s done and donate $500,000 to groups opposing hate speech. In his statement you can almost hear his arm being twisted: \u201cI oppose all forms of hatred and oppression and stand strong with communities that are marginalized and impacted every day. I am aware of the negative impact of my post towards the Jewish community and I take responsibility.\" But there was no explicit apology\u2014which tells us everything about what he really believes.\n\n>Honestly, there\u2019s little hope that he will change because he\u2019s insulated by fame and money and surrounded by yes-people. There is no motivation to learn how to distinguish propaganda from facts. All that\u2019s left is for the world to decide how it should respond to him.\n\n>Kareem Note: The problem of antisemitism is much bigger than Irving or Ye. They are merely the unwitting spokesperson for the right-wing political movement that is blatantly taking over the GOP. (For the full story, read \u201cJewish leaders call on GOP candidates to reject antisemitic comments\u201d). Many Republican candidates running for some of the most powerful positions in their states and in the country\u2014such as Pennsylvania\u2019s GOP gubernatorial nominee Doug Mastriano\u2014feel perfectly free to publicly spout antisemitic statements without fear of reprisal from their own party or the voters. That should be a very troubling sign for all marginalized groups because fascists always start by demonizing one group\u2014right before they go after the others.\n\n[Source](https:\/\/kareem.substack.com\/p\/shaq-kyrie-irving-idiot-has-twitter)","score":24617,"num_comments":1402,"author":"urfaselol","created_utc":1667497111000,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nba\/comments\/yl90o9\/kareems_take_on_kyrie_honestly_theres_little_hope\/","upvote_ratio":0.93,"over_18":false,"edited":false,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false}

{"id":"cecxoc","title":"People don't talk enough about how awful the Hornets are","selftext":"* One of only 6 teams in the NBA\/NFL\/MLB\/NHL that's never even made a conference finals. They're the second oldest of those 6 teams behind the Clippers.\n\n* They've only drafted 4 All-Stars that went on to play for them despite being around since 1988: Alonzo Mourning, Larry Johnson, Baron Davis, and Kemba Walker. And they've had the most chances to draft All-Stars too: the Hornets rank #1 with the lowest average draft spot in that time.\n\n* Then-coach Steve Clifford wanted the Hornets to draft Donovan Mitchell in 2017, but Rich Cho overruled him and drafted Malik Monk instead.\n\n* The Hornets were seriously looking to draft Pascal Siakam in 2016, but decided to trade their pick for Marco Belinelli who spent one year with the team before being traded to Atlanta in the Dwight Howard trade.\n\n* The Hornets were offered three first-round picks by the Celtics for the #9 pick in 2015. Michael Jordan turned the offer down to pick Frank Kaminsky. Kaminsky was always in the coach's doghouse here, his family hated Charlotte, and Kaminsky signed with Phoenix this offseason.\n\n* After having the worst record in NBA history in 2012, the Bobcats lost out on the #1 pick which was going to be Anthony Davis. They then selected Michael Kidd-Gilchrist with the #2 pick instead of Bradley Beal. In the same draft, they selected Jeffery Taylor with their 2nd round pick, just ahead of Draymond Green and Khris Middleton.\n\n* They did select Kemba Walker in 2011, but they also gave Stephen Jackson, Shaun Livingston, and the pick that would turn into Tobias Harris so they could jump up and draft Bismack Biyombo. They selected Biyombo instead of the player that had been mocked to them in several mock drafts: Kawhi Leonard. They also had Klay Thompson on the board.\n\n* The second best draft pick they've had since their 2004 rebirth has been Emeka Okafor.\n\n* They haven't won a playoff series since April 2002 when LeBron was in high school, Zion was 1 year old, The Scorpion King was #1 at the box office, Ashanti had the #1 song in America, and Hollywood Hogan was WWE Champion. The closest they've come to winning a series since then was the Purple Shirt Guy game when they were up 3-2 vs. the Heat and had cut a 9 point Heat lead to 2 with 1:30 left. A Hornets fan known as Purple Shirt Guy started inexplicably jawing with Dwyane Wade who proceeded to drop a quick 5 points to tie the series up. The Hornets would go on to lose Game 7 in Miami by 27 points.\n\n* Despite letting their best player ever walk for nothing, they're hard-capped at the moment. They'll be hard-capped this season with a starting 5 of Terry Rozier, Cody Zeller, Nic Batum, Dwayne Bacon, and Miles Bridges. Bismack Biyombo will be making $17 million off the bench, Marvin Williams will be making $15 million off the bench, and Michael Kidd-Gilchrist will be making $13 million off the bench. Nic Batum (who has turned into a completely worthless player) will be entering the 4th year of a 5 year deal (final year a player option) that will pay him $25.5 million. He'll almost certainly use that player option in 2020 and will be making $27.1 million.\n\n* The Hornets hired a new radio play-by-play guy before the start of the 2018-19 season that grew up a Hornets fan and was a beloved radio host in Charlotte. He was fired in the middle of a week in March with no explanation and no explanation has come out since.\n\n* Michael Jordan hasn't given an interview where he's discussed the Hornets in any detail (besides Kemba Walker) since 2014.\n\nSo as you bitch and complain about how your team hasn't done anything in a long time or how you only have one All-Star and you're disappointed you didn't get another, remember that things could always be worse.","score":23651,"num_comments":2712,"author":"None","created_utc":1563370563000,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nba\/comments\/cecxoc\/people_dont_talk_enough_about_how_awful_the\/","upvote_ratio":0.92,"over_18":false,"edited":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false}

{"id":"bowigy","title":"Rachel Nichols and the ESPN crew were extremely disrespectful last night","selftext":"I\u2019m not sure if this has been posted by someone already, but I just wanted to say that the things they let Rachel Nichols and Woj say during the draft lottery were blatantly disrespectful to all of the teams, save for maybe the Knicks, to all of the other draft picks, and to the Pelicans. Not to mention the fact that everything they were saying was being blasted throughout the entire venue. \n\nFirst off, there were over a dozen teams in attendance last night. The only one that they chose to talk about: the Knicks. They talked unbelievably liberally about Zion going to NY, as if they had already won it. However, as I doubt any of them realized, the Knicks had the same chance of obtaining the #1 pick as the Cavs and the Suns, the latter of which I don\u2019t even think was mentioned once on the broadcast.\n\nThen, there was Zion. Rachel Nichols kept referring to the #1 pick as \u201cwho gets Zion.\u201d Every time she said that or mentioned the kid, the camera would cut to the embarrassed 18 y\/o who was just there to see what team picks where. There is no guarantee that Zion will go #1 overall. It is very very likely, but not guaranteed. Not to mention that they did this in front of a large number of draft prospects in attendance. What does all of this coverage and press mean to them if it\u2019s only going to Zion?\n\nAnd finally, the Pelicans. Woj made every team\u2019s case for a possible AD trade that night. Whenever a team with chances of getting a top 10 pick was mentioned, Woj had to slip in that they may be looking to use that pick as an \u201casset\u201d to trade for AD. I\u2019m honestly very happy the Pelicans won because the disrespect they were receiving the whole night was greatly trumped when they won the first pick.\n\nNow I get all of these things are said ten times over on any other sports news broadcast. However, as I said, Rachel Nichols audio was blasted for everyone at the event to hear, including the draft prospects and team representatives.

In workouts, his trainer places sandbag weights below his ribcage in order to overload, and train, his diaphragm. He can coax his heart rate below 80 in one 90 second timeout.","selftext":"Super interesting article on Steph\u2019s conditioning: https:\/\/www.espn.com\/nba\/story\/_\/id\/30742095\/how-stephen-curry-organized-chaos-fuels-record-breaking-career-golden-state-warriors-rebuild\n\nSome other relevant quotes:\n\n> For Curry, a typical offseason workout looks something like this: Sporting a hilarious golfer's tan and usually some kind of colorful, prototype Under Armour sneaker, Curry flies through a nearly impossible, full-court version of the conventional star shooting drill. Designed by Payne, it consists of 10 shots -- from the corner, baseline and wing -- with full-court 94-foot sprints in between. And it must be done with a minimum 80% accuracy and in under 56 seconds or the drill repeats. Essentially it's the same drill run in nearly every basketball practice on earth, turbocharged to an absurd degree for Curry, whose year-round conditioning goal is to always be ready to take the floor within two weeks.\n\n > Last offseason, when Curry did this workout at Stanford, several Division I players in attendance begged to join in on Payne's ultimate scoring-without-the-ball drill -- they all either collapsed from exhaustion or gave up halfway through. That's exactly what Payne expects, though, since the drill is designed specifically to challenge Curry's remarkable conditioning and unique skill set in order to prepare him for challenges like the one against Portland.\n\n> \"Steph's definition of conditioning is different than most,\" Payne says. \"Lots of guys are in great shape. Can you be in the kind of great shape where you are fatigued after a long play like this and your quads are burning and you can't breathe but you can still maintain perfect mechanics and still make good decisions? Are you fatigued but can still execute at the highest levels?

{"id":"8k8wej","title":"Why LeBron would sign with every NBA team","selftext":"**Atlanta Hawks**\n\nLeBron is secretly a huge Twister fan. He will join the Hawks so he can film Twister 2 with their owner\u2019s wife on their off days.\n\n**Boston Celtics**\n\nLeBron misses Kyrie. He wants to play basketball with his friend and that means playing for the Celtics.\n\nOR\n\nLeBron wants to troll Kyrie. He will go to Boston management and ask them to trade Kyrie back to Cleveland if they want him to join. Danny Ainge will agree because he has no heart.\n\n**Brooklyn Nets**\n\nLeBron loves NY. He will go to New York to sign with the Knicks to play in historic Madison Square Garden. However, during the drive to the stadium, his driver makes a wrong turn and they end up in Brooklyn. LeBron realizes the mistake, but shrugs his shoulders and signs with the Nets instead, because he will have the same results with either the Knicks or Nets.\n\n\n**Charlotte Hornets**\n\nLeBron wants to prove he\u2019s better than Michael Jordan. He will sign with the Hornets to taunt MJ directly. He will win the Finals in 2019 with the Hornets and won\u2019t let MJ touch the trophy. After the season, LeBron will buy out MJ\u2019s shares and he will become majority owner. He will then trade himself to a better team because Dwight is too annoying and nobody will agree to LeBron\u2019s trade proposals involving Dwight.\n\n**Chicago Bulls**\n\nLeBron wants to prove he\u2019s better than Michael Jordan. He will sign with the Bulls so he can win 7 championships to pass what MJ did.\n\n\n**Cleveland Cavaliers**\n\nLeBron loves Cleveland as much as he hates moving. LeBron will re-sign with the Cavs, because it\u2019s more convenient than moving to a different city.\n\n**Dallas Mavericks**\n\nLeBron is still haunted by the 2011 Finals. He will go to Dallas to learn from the true GOAT Dirk Nowitzki. There, LeBron will lead the Mavs all the way to the number 1 seed in the West, only to lose to the Warriors in the first round after KD leaves for India to re-join his snek charmer friend.\n\n**Denver Nuggets**\n\nLeBron loves chicken nuggets. He will sign with Denver, only to be disappointed. He then will retire and start his own chicken nugget company.\n\n**Detroit Pistons**\n\nLeBron will become the new Pistons President of Basketball Operations. His first act in his new role will be to sign himself as the head coach\/starting SF. His second transaction will be to trade Blake Griffin to the Cavs for the 8th pick in the draft and salary filler, because LeBron will blackmail Dan Gilbert into doing it.\n\n**Golden State Warriors**\n\nLeBron wants all the ringz. He will sign with the Warriors for the veteran minimum so he can win not 1, not 2, not 3, not 4, not 5, not 6, not 7, not 8, not 9, but 10 championships.\n\n**Houston Rockets**\n\nLeBron loves space. He will sign with the Rockets so he can go to NASA and fly an actual rocket into space to find better competition on other planets. Mike Dan Tony will be confused why LeBron doesn\u2019t show up to their games. Mike, he\u2019s in space, deal with it.\n\n**Indiana Pacers**\n\nLeBron loves pace. He will sign with the Pacers so he can out-pace the other NBA players and win a championship. He will also become best friends with Lance Stephenson and the two will call out plays to each other by blowing in each other\u2019s rear, I mean ear.\n\n**LA Clippers**\n\nLeBron wants to live in Hollywood, but doesn\u2019t want to be under the shadow of Laker greats. If he can just lead the Clippers to the conference finals, they would rename their franchise LeBron\u2019s Clippers.\n\n**LA Lakers**\n\nLeBron wants to live in Hollywood, but doesn\u2019t want to be under the shadow of Clipper goods. He also wants to learn from the great Lavar Ball on how to play basketball as good as him.\n\n**Memphis Grizzlies**\n\nLeBron will not sign with the Memphis Grizzlies.\n\n**Miami Heat**\n\nLeBron will go back to Miami because he left his white headband there and wants it back.\n\n**Milwaukee Bucks**\n\nLeBron loves freaks. He will join the Greek Freak and sign with the Bucks. Then they will sign Rick James to preform every halftime so he can sing LeBron\u2019s favorite song \u201cSuper Freak\u201d\n\n**Minnesota Timberwolves**\n\nLeBron wants to learn from former MVP Derrick Rose. He also wants to torture his body and allow Coach Thibs to play him all 48 minutes for all 82 games.\n\n**New Orleans Pelicans**\n\nLeBron loves smoothies. He will join the Brow and sign with the Pelicans, so he can get unlimited smoothies at the Smoothie King Center.\n\n**New York Knicks**\n\nLeBron loves NY. He will go to New York to sign with the Knicks to play in historic Madison Square Garden. During the drive to the stadium, his driver makes the correct turn and they end up in MSG. LeBron realizes this and signs with the Knicks.\n\n**OKC Thunder**\n\nLeBron will sign with the Thunder so he can play with Russell Westbrook for one season, then leave after that and become an even better player.\n\n**Orlando Magic**\n\nLeBron will take his talents to Central Florida. He will sign with the Magic and lead them to another Finals lost.\n\n**Philadelphia 76ers**\n\nLeBron will sign with the 76ers because he trusts the process. LeBron will single handedly play bad for 3 seasons and tank so that the 76ers will get more draft picks to add to their squad. Then by age 37, LeBron will have what he needs to win another Eastern Conference Finals.\n\n**Phoenix Suns**\n\nLeBron loves hot-related teams. He will sign with the Suns and win 2 championships to prove to Pat Riley that he isn\u2019t so special with his so called \u201cHeat\u201d for the \u201cSuns\u201d are the hottest thing in the universe.\n\n**Portland Trail Blazers**\n\nLeBron loves Nike. He will sign with the Blazers so that he can spend his off days at Nike headquarters creating new shoes.\n\n**Sacramento Kings**\n\nLeBron is the King. He will sign with the Kings, because that\u2019s where he belongs.\n\n**San Antonio Spurs**\n\nLeBron loves Coach Pop. He will sign with the Spurs to learn from him, only to find out Coach Pop actually has no idea what he\u2019s doing and is just really lucky. LeBron will use that luck to convince Kawhy? To stay and they will win a championship every other year in 2019, 2021, and 2023.\n\n**Toronto Raptors**\n\nLeBron will sign with the Raptors just to check up on them and make sure they are ok.\n\n**Utah Jazz**\n\nLeBron loves jazz. He will sign with Utah only to find out they don\u2019t actually have jazz. He will then force a trade to New Orleans to be close to real jazz and because he remembered that he loves smoothies.\n\n**Washington Wizards**\n\nLeBron loves politics. He will sign with the Wizards so he can play basketball and also become the next president of the United States in 2020.\n\n\n\n**EDIT**\n\nSome of you have been asking for this, so here you go...\n\n**Seattle Supersonics**\n\nLeBron won't sign with this team because it doesn't exist.","score":23226,"num_comments":1301,"author":"samtaylor92","created_utc":1526601226000,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nba\/comments\/8k8wej\/why_lebron_would_sign_with_every_nba_team\/","upvote_ratio":0.87,"over_18":false,"edited":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false}

Josh reach out and sent me this.\nThank you everyone for you help and turning this into a success story!!!!!\n\nBack in the summer of 2017, we drafted Josh Hart out of Villanova with the 30th pick. I loved the pick cause I knew the kid was a baller and gave us some nice depth.\nHe made a tweet that summer while he was in Vegas getting ready for the summer league, about wanting to buy a Nintendo Switch. My little brother jokingly replied to him without expecting a response, but to our surprise, he did.\nThe conversation went as follows:\n\n http:\/\/imgur.com\/gallery\/WkSFMJm\n\nWe agreed on 200 dollars, tickets to a future game and the chance to meet with him for a Switch and Zelda Breath of the Wild. I shipped it to him overnight. As a life long Laker fan (I have a tattoo so I'm not playing around) I was ecstatic at having some kind of connection to a Laker, let alone one I genuinely liked.\n\nHe did PayPal me the 200 right when he got it, and he did reach out to me about what tickets I wanted. I asked him for the December 18th game...which was Kobe Bryant's jersey retirement. I knew the odds of getting those tickets were slim, but of course I'm going to shoot my shot at that game.\n\nThat was the last I heard from him. I have reached out to him through my personal Twitter, and my brother has attempted to as well. He reads the message, but never replies. I have joined his Twitch live streams and tried to get his attention there too, and he seems to ignore me there too.\n\nI have no ill will towards the man, I just want what we had agreed upon and not be ghosted. I feel waiting 2 seasons and still no tickets is pretty absurd at this point, and the lack of communication is the real ball buster.\n\nSo please Josh....just pay up bro.\n\nEDIT: http:\/\/imgur.com\/gallery\/mbNQqig \n\nSome personal DMs from me to him.

{"id":"byskdn","title":"The Outrage of NBA Fans is Disproportionate.","selftext":"I'd like to preface this by stating that what GSW part-owner Mark Stevens did in game 3 was unacceptable. He pushed Kyle Lowry and deserves to be fined and suspended from attending games.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nHowever, it is my opinion that the outcry has been wildly disproportionate to other acts of violence in the NBA.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI realise that it was less about the fact that the 60 year old Silicon Valley venture capitalist might've hurt Lowry with his left handed push and was more just the fact that he laid his hands on a player in an unfriendly way. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe public outcry has been intense. People are calling for a lifetime ban and demanding that he be forced to sell his shares in the team. The incident is already written on his Wikipedia page.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nPeople are out for blood with Kyle Lowry leading the charge.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n>\"A guy like that, showing his true class, and he shouldn't be a part of our league. There's just no place for that.\"\n\n&nbsp;\n\n>\"The support I've gotten from fellow players, the league, has been unbelievable. With that being said, I think more should be done.\"\n\n&nbsp;\n\n>\"I have 2 young children and being able to hold myself to a certain standard. Which I do. I hold myself to a high, high standard.\"\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThese are all quotes from Kyle Lowry. The same Kyle Lowry who in 2012 pled guilty to the battery of a female referee at a charity basketball game. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nThis was one of his quotes on that day:\n\n&nbsp;\n\n>\"B****, meet me outside. I will kick your a**!\"\n\n&nbsp;\n\nHe then proceeded to throw a basketball at her for a second time, as hard as he could. He (potentially) received a fine of up to $1,000 and was suspended for 0 games. 500 times less than Mark Stevens got for his push. The fine was from a judge in a courtroom and not even from the league. The league did nothing. There is no mention of this on Lowry's wikipedia page. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nIf Lowry thinks $500,000 and a year ban is soft for Mark Stevens then I wonder what he thought about his $0, 0 game punishment for battery of a woman in 2012?\n\n&nbsp;\n\nIn August of 2010, beloved NBA clown Lance Stephenson pushed his pregnant girlfriend down a staircase and then proceeded to bash her head against the stairs. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nTwo years prior to this he sexually assaulted a 17 year old girl at his high school.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nHe went on to play over 500 NBA games and earn over $35 million dollars. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nAt the time of the staircase attack, he hadn't played a single NBA game. 9 years later, he's still in the league. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nI was a fan of Lance but only because I'd never heard this mentioned in a single one of his games. I even paid actual money to buy his Charlotte Hornets jersey. I wore his name and number on my back. Call me old fashioned, but I think that the second you bash your pregnant girlfriend's head against some stairs, you should forfeit the privilege of playing NBA basketball.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nOJ Mayo and Tyreke Evans were both given 2 year bans for violating the NBA anti-drug program. The NBA is prohibited from disclosing what type of drugs they were found to have taken but reports suggest the violations were related to \"drugs of abuse\" which implies they were recreational and not performance enhancing.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nJason Kidd was fined $200 (by a judge) for abusing his wife. He was suspended for 0 games.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nDarren Collison, Jason Kidd, Jason Richardson. The NBA has a history of letting abusers off lightly. All just because they're good at basketball.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI'm a firm believer in forgiveness and giving people second chances but if Kyle Lowry and NBA fans think Mark Stevens should be banned for life then Kyle Lowry should've never become a Raptor, Jason Kidd should not be the league's highest paid assistant coach and Lance Stephenson should've never played a minute in the NBA. \n\n&nbsp;","score":22832,"num_comments":2891,"author":"WarlandoMagic","created_utc":1560134972000,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nba\/comments\/byskdn\/the_outrage_of_nba_fans_is_disproportionate\/","upvote_ratio":0.79,"over_18":false,"edited":false,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false}

That means he's giving up a lot of what he gives you. And 108, as mentioned above, isn't anything special.  [Here is the full list of players who have made at least 3 all-star games with Carmelo's defensive rating or worse, capped at Melo's offensive rating.](https:\/\/www.basketball-reference.com\/play-index\/psl_finder.cgi?request=1&match=combined&type=totals&per_minute_base=36&per_poss_base=100&season_start=1&season_end=-1&lg_id=NBA&age_min=0&age_max=99&is_playoffs=N&height_min=0&height_max=99&birth_country_is=Y&as_comp=gt&as_val=3&pos_is_g=Y&pos_is_gf=Y&pos_is_f=Y&pos_is_fg=Y&pos_is_fc=Y&pos_is_c=Y&pos_is_cf=Y&c1stat=def_rtg&c1comp=gt&c1val=108&c2stat=off_rtg&c2comp=lt&c2val=108&order_by=ws)\nCarmelo, Joe Johnson, Tom Chambers, Latrell Sprewell, Richard Hamilton.

He only made it out of the first round once.\n \n####First: Melo has never been better than LeBron. \nLebron was born on December 30th, 1984. He was immediately better than Carmelo. Every second since that moment, LeBron has been increasing the distance between them. They came into the league at the same moment: one committed to perpetual improvement, the other, Carmelo Anthony. Twin spaceships traveling at different velocities. To calculate the distance between them now, you'd have to figure out some way to make Melo's spaceship actually start going in reverse and then explode. I'm too dumb to figure that out, so we're moving on.\n\n####Second: Denver Melo was  *never* better than Kobe or Dirk\nFrom 2005-2012, there wasnt a single season he was better than Kobe or Dirk. Melo *never* finishes above these guys in all-nba over this period. Not once. More importantly, with the benefit of retrospect, we can see these two (along with LeBron) were great every season, always healthy, and whenever they had *any* talent around them, contended for titles\/MVPs. They got everything out of their team, year after year. There's not a single season you wouldn't trade Melo for one of these three and improve Denver.  (To preemptively shut down the idea Melo was better than Dirk in 2009, when he beat the Mavs in the second round: Dirk averaged 34\/12\/4 on 53\/38\/92 shooting in that series--if you put Dirk on that Nuggets team, they would've been even better. Dirk was also 1st team All-Nba to Melo's 3rd. Melo also didn't even make the all-star team.)\n\nSo: Melo is at best, the 4th best player any season from 2005-2012. I now just have to establish that there were at least *2* other guys who were better each season during that period, and I can knock Denver Melo out of the top 5 rankings.\n\n#### Numbers 4, 5, 6 \nHere i'm going to list three players (in any order), that I think were conclusively better than Melo in each corresponding season. Why three, when I only need two? Because fuck Melo. Honestly, in a lot of these seasons I could list ~10+ players. Finally, just because someone like Nash or Duncan drops out doesnt necessarily mean I think they're no longer better than Melo--they probably are--it's just that there are 3 more inarguable players. \n\n##### 2005-2011\n2005 | 2006 | 2007| 2008 | 2009 | 2010 | 2011\n- | - | - | - | - | - | -  \nNash | Nash | Nash | Dwight | Dwight | Dwight | Rose\nDuncan | Duncan | Duncan | CP3 | CP3 | Durant | Durant\nShaq | Wade | Wade | Garnett | Wade | Wade | Wade\n\n\n\n### Melo in New York\nUnlike his team USA compatriots, Melo was uninterested in forming a superteam, instead taking the money and forcing his way to the Knicks. While not as athletic as Denver Melo, it was in NYC where Anthony peaked as a shooter. It's also here where he gained more weight and started missing lots of games. He won *one* playoff series in his entire time with the Knicks. In the east, guys.\n\nAnd then it got worse. Knicks Melo never made the playoffs, let alone an all-nba team after 2013, so we can pretty much throw all those years out for top 5 purposes. Just because people still *thought* he was good, I went all the way to 2015, where became pretty clear he's wasnt even top 15 anymore. Kobe and Dirk start declining here, so I expanded it to **4** players besides LeBron. Still wasnt very hard. Durant basically slots in for Dirk as the new non-Lebron forward always clearly ahead of Melo.\n\nAs a sidenote: the Denver Nuggets won more games than the Knicks in 3 of the next 4 seasons (including 57 in 2012), and only finished behind in 2014 by 1 game (37 to 36). \n \n##### 2012-2015\n\n2012| 2013| 2014| 2015\n- | - | - | -\nKobe | Duncan | Steph | Steph |\nDurant | Durant | Durant | Durant |\nCP3 | CP3 | CP3 | Westbrook | \nDwight | M.Gasol | Harden | Harden |\n\n##### 2013: The year Melo might have been top 5\nOk, even I have to admit this. In 2013, Melo has a decent case for his only top 5 season. He leads the league in scoring, shoots a good percentage, and even wins a playoff series. It's by far his best season as a Knick, and likely, the best season of his career. He has a career high in ws\/48, with .184, and finishes 9th overall in offensive win shares (really high for him).\n\nMelo also finishes 3rd in MVP voting, and while I think this is partially because of his exaggerated reputation at the time (and being in NYC), he did have a great year. \n\nStill though: LeBron, Durant, clearly better. CP3 has far better advanced stats and won more games in a harder conference.  Tim Duncan makes 1st team all-nba, and is the best player on the Spurs team that goes to the finals. Marc Gasol wins Defensive player of the year, wins more games, and goes to the western conference finals. He finishes *3rd* in VoRP behind LeBron and Durant. It's counter-intuitive, but Gasol has a really strong argument. That's 5, but we also have Harden and Curry starting to push their way into the conversation, and honestly, I'd take either of them over Melo in 2013. That's 7. \n\nMaybe I'm wrong there.

{"id":"hzej5j","title":"[OC] Taco Tuesdays have eaten into LeBron\u2019s productivity and I have the data to prove it.","selftext":"One of the most unappetizing developments in the NBA is LeBron James\u2019 recent obsession with Taco Tuesdays[.](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/TzuaeHS) And I\u2019m not talking about the broader issue of [cultural appropriation](https:\/\/www.sbnation.com\/nba\/2019\/11\/12\/20940959\/lebron-james-taco-tuesday-videos-lakers-problem) or his sad [attempt to trademark](https:\/\/bleacherreport.com\/articles\/2851790-lebron-james-files-to-trademark-taco-tuesday-after-viral-social-media-posts) the phrase. I\u2019m talking about how the King\u2019s curious obsession with eating tacos on Tuesdays, has led to him eating Ls on the box score.\n\nAlmost every culture has a kind of taco. The Greeks have gyros. The French have crepes. Italians have calzones. Americans have Taco Bell. Folding dough around a medley of meat and veggies is a food concept as old as time. And while everyone enjoys tacos, some of us are more fanatic than others\u2026\n\nEnter [El Reye](https:\/\/www.elreytaqueria.com\/), LeBron James.\n\n<[LeBron James Taco Tuesday Video](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=9YRDVaW1qA4)\\>\n\nThe man\u2019s awkward passion for Taco Tuesday tends to evoke mixed reactions: anywhere between smiling at the heartwarming dad vibes and a literal whole-body cringe. And I won\u2019t deny, as a proper Houstonian who takes his tacos very seriously, I was suspicious when I first heard grumblings of the [Ohio](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/List_of_U.S._states_by_Hispanic_and_Latino_population)\\-native\u2019s weekly affair. So, I looked to the numbers to see if there is more to this meat-and-cheese filled story.\n\n# \u201cIt\u2019s just like Taco Tuesdays. It\u2019s a (expletive) thing.\u201d\n\nBefore biting into the data, I needed to pinpoint the origins of James\u2019 taco-bsession (taco-obsession, hehe). After an exhaustive multi-minute googling sesh, the earliest observance I could find is this [Instagram story](https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/watch\/?v=507218733062687) from August 2018.\n\nJust a few weeks later we got further confirmation of LeBron\u2019s enthusiasm for weekday alliteration-themed occasions during a post-practice Q&A. His fervent response to the media\u2019s questions about his \u201c[White Boy Wednesdays](https:\/\/www.usatoday.com\/story\/sports\/nba\/lakers\/2018\/09\/26\/lebron-lakers-eminem-white-boy-wednesday\/1437137002\/)\u201d playlist gave it all away:\n\n>*\u201cIt\u2019s a universal thing, right?\u2019\u2019 he asked reporters, with a smile. \u201cIt\u2019s just like taco Tuesdays. It\u2019s a (expletive) thing.\u201d*\n\n*It\u2019s a (expletive) thing.* Profound words with profound implications. It\u2019s at this point we can confidently presume Taco Tuesday is a staple in the James house. His videos would increase in frequency and social media buzz throughout the 2018-19 season before reaching a zeitgeist level of furor with this May \u201819 [insta-story](https:\/\/twitter.com\/BleacherReport\/status\/1133586182720430080?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1133586182720430080%7Ctwgr%5E&ref_url=about%3Ablank).\n\nThus, we can split LeBron\u2019s career is into two distinct periods:\n\n* **Pre-Taco Tuesday Era**: 2003-04 \u2013 2017-18 seasons\n* **Taco Tuesday Era**: 2018-19 \u2013 2019-20 seasons\n\nWith a reliable taco timeline established, it\u2019s time to count the beans.\n\n# The Taco-nalysis\n\nI began by compiling LeBron\u2019s career game logs (the population) and identifying the day of the week each game was played on. Next, I pulled in his Season Averages (the control group) and selected the following 10 stat categories to get a comprehensive picture of his performance: [Game Score](https:\/\/www.nba.com\/resources\/static\/team\/v2\/thunder\/statlab-gamescore-191201.pdf), Points, Field Goal %, 3-Point %, Free Throw %, Total Rebounds, Assists, Steals, Blocks, and Turnovers. For each of these stats, I compared his average performance for each day of the week to his overall average for the corresponding season.\n\nExample: for the 2003-04 NBA season, LeBron averaged 20.9 Points per game. On Sundays that season, he averaged 26.6 Points per game. So, for Sunday during the \u201803-04 season, LeBron had a Points per game variance of +27.3%. This calculation is repeated for each day of the week for each of the 10 stat categories for each of LeBron\u2019s seasons in the league.\n\n<[Example of Analysis](https:\/\/imgur.com\/r1tNBxo)\\>\n\nA 5% variance threshold was used to clearly delineate between good and bad performances. Meaning, daily stat averages greater than +5% of the season average are considered \u201cPositive\u201d (green), variances less than -5% are considered \u201cNegative\u201d (red) and variances within those bounds are considered \u201cNeutral\u201d (yellow). This threshold divided the data points into the three stratums equally.\n\n# Pre-Taco Tuesday Era\n\nThis analysis examined 1,050 total data points from the period before LeBron discovered tacos (10 stats x 7 days per week x 15 seasons) and found an unambiguous trend: The King played better on [*Tuesdays*](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=CaA9EBPgdQI).\n\n<[Pre-Taco Tuesday Era - % of Variances by Day of Week](https:\/\/imgur.com\/lweNvDu)\\>\n\nSince LeBron entered the league, his Tuesday night performances had registered the lowest rate of Negative variances and the highest rate of Positive variances. Meaning, Tuesday is the day he was *least* likely to perform *worse* than his season average, and the day he was *most* likely to perform *better* than his season average.\n\nWhen looking at the stat variances cumulatively, his Tuesday performance stands out even more!\n\n<[Pre-Taco Tuesday Era - Cumulative Avg Stat Variances by Day of Week](https:\/\/imgur.com\/ZLRuKu2)\\>\n\nTuesdays had a Total Average Variance of 2.4%. Meaning, in the pre-Taco Tuesday era, LeBron posted an average stat line +2.4% better than his season average on Tuesday nights.\n\nAnd with LeBron being undoubtedly the best player on his teams, we\u2019d expect that Tuesday performance bump to be reflected in the Win\/Loss column\u2026 It was.\n\n<[Pre Taco-Tuesday Era - Win % by Day of Week](https:\/\/imgur.com\/OYsznFX)\\>\n\nHe came out victorious in 71% of his Tuesday outings in the pre-Taco Tuesday era - more than 4% better than his overall win rate for the same period.\n\nThis is where things get bleak. LeBron-stans, now would be the time to log off.\n\n# Oh, How the Tacos have Turned\n\nEveryone thought LeBron\u2019s biggest weakness was his hairline. Turns out, it\u2019s tacos.\n\nPrior to his weekly taco tradition, LeBron\u2019s Tuesday performance had the lowest rate of negative variances and the highest rate of positive variances. In the first two seasons of the Taco Tuesday era, James\u2019 sacred day saw an +11% uptick in negative variances and a -17% drop in positive variances.\n\n<[Taco Tuesday Era - % of Variances by Day of Week](https:\/\/imgur.com\/9U52kqx)\\>\n\nLooking at the stats in aggregate we get an even better sense for his drop in Tuesday performance. LeBron is suddenly performing notably worse than his season average in most of the key stats! A complete reversal of the trend from the days before his taco titillations.\n\n<[Taco Tuesday Era - Cumulative Avg Stat Variances by Day of Week](https:\/\/imgur.com\/7yqOxme)\\>\n\nSuffice it to say, LeBron\u2019s average Tuesday performance has fallen flatter than Casa Ole\u2019s\u00ae velveeta-covered tostada. For those of you residing outside the great state of Texas, allow this trip advisor review to enlighten you on our state\u2019s worst Mexican chain.\n\n<[Casa Ole Review](https:\/\/imgur.com\/gsPK5cA)\\>\n\nSimilar to how Montezuma\u2019s revenge transforms local cuisines into violent bowel movements, we\u2019d expect LeBron\u2019s *shitty* Tuesday performance to translate to the Win\/Loss column\u2026 it did.\n\n<[Taco Tuesday Era - Win % by Day of Week](https:\/\/imgur.com\/5CW6EPT)\\>\n\nSince the weekday shenanigans began, LeBron\u2019s Tuesday Win % has lagged his overall Win % by -2%.\n\nTo put all these numbers into perspective, here\u2019s a few Taco-mparisons for you to consider.\n\n# Taco-mparison\n\nThese graphs give a sense of just how different LeBron\u2019s Tuesday nights were in the two eras.\n\n<[Taco-mpare: Total Avg Variance (Era vs Era)](https:\/\/imgur.com\/3wkUCgn)\\>\n\n<[Taco-mpare: % of +\/- Variances on Tuesdays (Era vs Era)](https:\/\/imgur.com\/VfCmYq2)\\>\n\n<[Taco-mpare: GmSc (Era vs Era)](https:\/\/imgur.com\/L1LBiIk)\\>\n\n<[Taco-mpare: Tuesday Win%  (Era vs Era)](https:\/\/imgur.com\/KUtASdv)\\>\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Ta co-nclude\n\nIt\u2019s becoming difficult to separate LeBron\u2019s on-court performance from his escalating taco mania.

The NBA curiously scheduled no Tuesday night matchups for the Lakers in the bubble restart. I don\u2019t mean to stoke the r\/nba conspiracy flames but if that sus pattern holds for the playoff schedule, we\u2019ll need an official response from Adam Silver.\n\n<[Lakers Bubble Schedule](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/AKPAKSr)\\>\n\n*Note: the author* [*contacted the*](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/1ofjV3y) *the NBA League Office for comment but they did not respond prior to posting on reddit.*\n\nLooking past the current season, however, should Jeanie Buss and the Lakers consider intervening?\n\nOn the one hand, LeBron should face the mariachi music and acknowledge the way he\u2019s let down his teammates, coaches and fans these past two taco-slowed seasons.\n\nOn the other hand, despite his Tuesday distraction and the performance decline it\u2019s wrought, LeBron had an MVP-caliber season and led his team to the #1 seed in the Western conference[.](https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/26Fxuue3LMkwbs3Sg\/giphy.gif)\n\nWhat his teammates, coaches and fans deserve most is an unencumbered LeBron. An on-court LeBron who\u2019s fully present *every* time he suits up; undistracted by the allure of alliteration themed dinner nights. And, an off-court LeBron who can freely indulge his primal taco impulses each and every Tuesday night. A LeBron so fully self-actualized it\u2019d make Michael stop crying.\n\nThus, the data offers but one solution: **Taco Load Management**\n\nFrank Vogel should rest LeBron on Tuesday nights so he can pursue his conflicting passions uninhibited.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou can check out the formatted write-up and all my research [here](https:\/\/drive.google.com\/drive\/folders\/1c9-qJzJ3mcm2gxgDMk1KdnWhOWuSE26q?usp=sharing)!\n\nAll the graphs are summarized in [this imgur album](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/TzuaeHS)","score":20592,"num_comments":565,"author":"AngryCentrist","created_utc":1595942460000,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nba\/comments\/hzej5j\/oc_taco_tuesdays_have_eaten_into_lebrons\/","upvote_ratio":0.92,"over_18":false,"edited":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false}

{"id":"collc1","title":"I sold Josh Hart a Nintendo Switch in 2017. And he has paid me back","selftext":"A few months ago I posted about my situation with now former Los Angeles Lakers Guard, Josh Hart. If your not familiar with the story, [here it is](https:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/nba\/comments\/brvala\/i_sold_josh_hart_a_switch_in_2017_and_he_still\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x).\n\nI never expected it to get the kind of attention it did. My plan was to share a pretty unique story with people, hopefully get Josh's attention and just get some tickets. Comments were hilarious and people's opinions are always good to read. I was pretty taken back with the kind of support people where willing to give me, one person going as far as to wanting to start a GoFundMe to get some tickets. So just a quick shout out to the people of Reddit, you guys are amazing.\n\nJuly 6th, the Lakers acquired Anthony Davis. The Woj Bomb hit my phone and when I came across Josh Hart's name in the trade, I couldn't help but laugh. My friends hitting me up about it and even some Redditors taking some jabs at me. [Sacrifices had to be made I suppose.](https:\/\/np.reddit.com\/r\/lakers\/comments\/c134ht\/some_sacrifices_had_to_be_made_for_anthony_davis\/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) Josh and I actually contacted each other a few times over Twitter after the trade. He assured me that he was still going to take care of me, and I wasn't in any kind of rush. The kid just got traded, and I imagine for a young player that can be pretty hectic.\n\n[He sent me a box in the mail.](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/gvtdKou) A pair of Nike Lakers Shorts, a Lakers warm up shirt, a Lakers long sleeve shirt, 2 hats and a bag. But the cherry on top...a pair of signed game worn Kobe's, and a signed game worn number 5 rookie Josh Hart jersey. I have never owned anything game worn before, so I was floored. The smile this put on my face made me realize, I am completely happy with what I got.\n\nBeing a life long Lakers fan, I jumped at the opportunity to sell a Laker something just to have a cool story out of it. At the end of the day, I have a better story than I could have imagined. Am I going to get tickets? I don't know, and I'm not expecting them. I can always buy tickets, (as expensive as they may be) but this story and what I got in the end is worth more to me than tickets.\n\nIf there is anything more that I could ask for I guess, would be to meet Josh in person and have a laugh about all of this. That, and maybe a few rounds of Smash Bros. 4 stock, no items, Final Destination. I play a pretty mean Snake.\n\nEdit: Apologies if I came off as asking for more. That was not my intention whatsoever. I could've made a better choice of words, but I don't expect anymore. I could've done without the smash Bros comment, but I wasn't asking for more. I got more than I asked for.","score":20175,"num_comments":998,"author":"ssmith2452","created_utc":1565461232000,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nba\/comments\/collc1\/i_sold_josh_hart_a_nintendo_switch_in_2017_and_he\/","upvote_ratio":0.87,"over_18":false,"edited":true,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false}

As soon as it touches his hands, Klay shoots it. Draymond was like, \u201cWhat were you doing? Why would you shoot that?\u201d Klay said, \u201cDog, they pay me to shoot the ball.\u201d","selftext":"[Source](https:\/\/theathletic.com\/2779712\/2021\/08\/23\/the-randomness-of-klay-thompson-its-impossible-to-know-him-and-not-love-him)\n\nMore Klay stories below:\n>Jack: We\u2019re in Atlanta and we wanted to hang out at a nightclub. We\u2019re all there, texting Klay, and he\u2019s like, \u201cWhere are you guys at?\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cYo, we\u2019re over here.\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cCool, I\u2019m about to meet you guys.\u201d So Klay comes, but when he walks in, he walks in by himself. I\u2019m like, \u201cYo, man, how did you get here?\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cYeah, man, I was hanging out at this bar, some people asked me where I was going, they said they were going to the same place, so, shit, I just hopped in the cab and split a cab with them.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cWhat people?\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cThat couple over there.\u201d And it was like two married, middle-aged White people.\n\n>DeGregorio: Klay\u2019s first contract, they were negotiating, and in the middle he had to leave. He was like, \u201cGuys, I have to go home now, I got to go home and feed my dog.\u201d\n\n&nbsp;\n\n>DeGregorio: His rookie season, there was a game where Klay took too many 3s for Monta Ellis\u2019s liking. During the next timeout, I remember Monta Ellis just ripped into this rookie: \u201cYou\u2019re taking too many shots. Pass the ball. You\u2019re just a rook.\u201d That type of deal. I remember watching Klay the whole time, and he never flinched. He never wavered. The very next offensive possession, ball swings, goes to Klay. He takes the first shot and makes a 3. I\u2019m thinking, \u201cThis kid is an ice-cold killer.\u201d\n\n>Ezeli: One game, I think we were up three with about 15 seconds left and somebody threw the ball to Klay. At this point, you just hold the ball, right? As soon as it touches his hands, Klay shoots it. I can\u2019t remember if he made it or not, but I remember his conversation with Draymond afterwards. Draymond was like, \u201cYo, what were you doing?! Why would you shoot that?\u201d And Klay said, \u201cDog, they pay me to shoot the ball.\u201d","score":18795,"num_comments":954,"author":"GuyCarbonneauGOAT","created_utc":1629730728000,"url":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/nba\/comments\/pa1izw\/festus_ezeli_one_game_we_were_up_3_with_15\/","upvote_ratio":0.94,"over_18":false,"edited":false,"spoiler":false,"stickied":false}

Must they run their mouths like that? Unfortunately, a lot of kids and some adults take these ignorant comments seriously. Look, there might be a cautionary lesson in LeBron for kids. This is what happens when you attempt to leave high school a year early to join the NBA. And it's always unwise to seek political advice from someone who gets paid a hundred million dollars a year to bounce a ball. Oh and LeBron and Kevin? You're great players but no one voted for you. Millions elected Trump to be their coach. So keep the political commentary to yourself, or as someone once said, \"shut up and dribble\".**\n\n**[Bonus](https:\/\/streamable.com\/7syqn) (she continued after returning from break):**\n\n>**I'm still trying to get over the fact that Kevin Durant said, \"I feel like our country is not *ran* by a great coach.\" Does that mean I should go for a *ran* tomorrow morning before my radio show?
