Ask me anything!",Mike Prada,Analyst,Analyst,"Is it possible the three-point revolution actually transformed basketball MORE than we've realized? 

That's the premise of my new book, SPACED OUT, which released today (November 1). It's a book about how the three-point revolution essentially doubled the size of the floor in the span of less than a decade, how we got to this point in the sport's history and what adding all that extra room on the floor has done for the game's strategies, tactics, Xs and Os, player skill sets, and much more.

I've been editing and writing about NBA tactics for more than a decade while working for [SB Nation](https://www.sbnation.com/authors/mike-prada), [FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/mike-prada/), [my own newsletter](https://mikeprada.substack.com/) and now [The Athletic](https://theathletic.com/author/mike-prada/). This book is in many ways the culmination of that work. So I'm here to answer any questions about the premise, the journey the league has taken to get to this point, the NBA season so far (womp womp Wizards), my current gig at The Athletic, and anything else, really.

It's Spencer Dinwiddie, guard for the Washington Wizards. After playing in the NBA for 7 years, I have a lot of thoughts on how to shake things up. If I was the Commissioner, I would let players sell sponsorships on their jerseys, I wouldn’t tech them for heckling courtside fans and I’d have teams play a tournament for the #1 draft pick. 

That’s just the beginning, though. You can hear all of my thoughts on The Players' Tribune YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MjQ_edB3VA&amp;list=PLXxForFmBnEvj0hhHIXkCf1eM274LFDci

I'm the author of ""CAN'T KNOCK THE HUSTLE: Inside the Season of Protest, Pandemic and Progress with the Brooklyn Nets’ Superstars of Tomorrow"" — and I've been a huge devotee of r/nba since I started B/R Mag at Bleacher Report, which was a continuation of my work as a top editor at The New York Times, The Guardian, The Atlantic and Esquire. It's the spirit of this community — that culture beyond the game — that I hope makes my book stand out from everyday sports writing.

While embedded with the Nets, I marched in the streets and meditated on mid-virus Zooms with NBA players. I analyzed Supreme Court documents with Kyrie Irving and spent a very late night at Kevin Durant's house. I was, as KD said, ""everywhere"" during an historic time for basketball... and the world.

I'm here to elaborate on any of the news you may have seen come out of my reporting: Kyrie's disappearing acts and his activism. KD's phone-in-the-locker-room obsession and his hush-hush recruitment. The truth about Boston and the Bay, LeBron and The Beard. But if you have any questions on the bigger picture of the NBA's influence, I'm also here to offer what my book does: an unvarnished portrait of power and fame in sports today, from player empowerment taking over the front office to the platform of celebrities expanding in the real world.

I joined USA TODAY Sports after covering the Golden State Warriors for Bay Area News Group (2017-19). Before that, I was the Los Angeles Lakers beat writer with the Los Angeles Daily News (2012-17) and a Lakers blogger with the Los Angeles Times (2010-12). I fell in love with basketball in the early 1990s, embracing the unique stars of the league and the game’s unpredictable outcomes. When I wasn’t watching, I was playing – either at a local park or in my family’s driveway with my younger brother and “Jock Jams” serving as the in-game soundtrack.

Hi Reddit, Jeff Zillgitt here. I have worked at USA TODAY since 1995 and covered a little bit of everything, but I’ve been on the NBA beat full-time since 2010 and have covered every NBA Finals since 2008. Over the years, Dwyane Wade and Kyle Korver have been two of my favorite interviews. I fell in love with basketball watching Julius Erving and Magic Johnson and going to practices when my dad coached high school basketball. I’ve filed stories from eight Olympics, six men’s Final Fours, seven World Series and six Super Bowls. My favorite dateline is KRASNAYA POLYANA, Russia – from the Sochi Olympics. Or BAD AXE, Mich. – from Michigan’s thumb region. I love music, especially concerts, and I wish had more time to fly-fish. Though no basketball in the spring gave me more time than normal to hit some of my favorite mountain streams.

@JackPail: If you could dunk on any current NBA player, who would it be and why?

&gt; Hahaha. That is the easiest one for me. That would be LeBron James. Because were friends. I want that notch on my belt. If i did in my last year i would prob get a tech for it. I would love to dunk on him

   

@MrFunFact: What was your favorite part about playing with LeBron?

&gt; Two guys that came in the league together in 2003. We built more than a friendship. We built a brotherhood togher. For us to decide to play together at that time for one goal to compete and win championships. It will definitely go down as one of the best players to play the game

   

@Coco9: Who's the GOAT?

&gt; Michael Jordan. I watched him win 6 titles. My biggest takeaway is the first one they won in '91 Being a 9 year old kid, seeing the Chicago Bulls do that ... that gave me the vision to say 'Ok, that's what I want to do for the rest of my life.' That's the feeling I want to bring to this city and my family

   

@srichmondBR: Best team plane gambling story?

&gt; We did A LOT of gambling ... I don't know what people think are good gambling stories about losing money hahah. The most memorable was Mario Chalmers. We played this game called Booray. You can put a ghost in the game and the ghost fades the pot.  And Mario Chalmers was winning. LeBron was the ghost and the last hand he flipped over beat Mario Chalmers and I think he was out like 50K or something like that. The moment of it was so dramatic and we ran up and down the plane screaming and yelling because there's no way you're gonna lose to the ghost being up as big as he was when the game started. That was crazy

   

@BronGOAT23: Who's your top 5 NBA players of all time?

&gt; My list has definitely changed. Thats hard to pick man. MJ is my fave of all time. Lebron is right there. Kobe Bryant. Allen Iverson. If i had to pick one more it would be shaq

   

@jmvone119: Why did you give Aaron Gordon a 9?

&gt; Hahaha because I felt that dunk deserved a 9. For the record, a 9 is actually not a bad thing. ... I thought that dunk deserved a 9 because he didn't clear him. ... People are still talking about the Dunk Contest. ... People are still talking about it months later. As judges we did our job. We made it interesting and something that people keep wanting to talk about

   

@TheSpidaMan: You have a favorite young star you just love to watch?

&gt; I got a few. Trae Young, Luka Doncic, Donovan Mitchell, D'Angelo Russel, Devin Booker. The game is in such great hands

   

@JapaneseSnake: Can you dunk over Tacko? If you can I'd love to see it

&gt; In my prime, FASHO

   

@JCTheLit: What NBA legend do you wish you could have played with?

&gt; Michael Jordan

   

What is your favorite game or play of your career?

&gt; Game winner vs the bulls one legged in miami double OT. on the stands

   

@justin_in_time: Did you ever have a chat with LeBron about having confidence in Spo as a coach when it looked like he was potentially calling for Pat Riley to come back and coach the team?

&gt; You know what he never honestly called for pat to come back. The media made up a lot of the early start. We were 9-7. Media was lbron wants this or that. Spo was perfect for that time. Spo did a great job coaching us. We went to 4 finals. Spo did his job

   

@cindy_robinson: How have you been staying busy during the quarantine? Tell us about Wine Down

&gt; They're daily lives are as interesting as it is in the world. Just doing things with the family that i didn't get to do during my career. Actually have dinner together. Give each other that undivided attention. Wine Down.. I love wine. When i started to get into the wine business that one thing i love was the conversation. I've had wine makers, athletes, just different people

   

@BigNetsGuy15: What's your favorite jersey ever?

&gt; I think im a little bias of marquette. That was my first jersey that had my name on the back. That was a big deal. I love blue and gold. I used to stare at that jersey for hours. It was a big deal for me

   

@DumbDingus: What was it like to win your first championship?

&gt; It was amazing. For me i never won a champion of that magnitude. Whatever sport i played i never won that sport as a teen. For me to get it in the nba in my second year it made me really hungry. Made me hungrier than i could ever be. It was an amazing feeling. It was one of the best feelings ever.

   

@jmul10: What was your relationship with Kobe like?

&gt; I built one. Early on kobe didn't have a lot of relationships. I got a chance to build one with the respect of kobe. I can call him anytime and vice versa. That's one of the relationships that i'm proud of. To be able to have one with one of my fave players of all time was special",104,35,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/g3hcaw

We all know the deal by now. The NBA isn't around, and it doesn't look we're even close to have it back with the state of quarantine getting active in most countries and parts of the world. I personally have three weeks (if they don't get prolonged even more) of lockdown ahead, and I have my collection of SLAM Magazines with me.

Proof, just in case: **[SLAM Magazine full collection, ish 1 to 226.](https://imgur.com/k2S9nGV)**

As I'm researching basketball stuff often, I decided to index every single number of the collection in a spreadsheet including all of the articles/columns/topics covered in them, the players, the teams, the leagues they belonged to at the time of publication, etc... so I could actually use all of the information and have it at one click's distance.
***
I'm still working from home these days but as most of you out there I find myself having to fill my free time doing something, so hey, why not provide some answers to questions you might have about basketball back in the day that SLAM happened to cover? If I'm going to waste my free time, I might at least entertain myself and others or help you get some interesting info from the mags.

Hope to read from yall. I'll try my best to reply to your messages! And more than anything stay safe out there fam!

How exactly does someone become a financial detective in the sports industry? Sit back, relax, and I will tell you the tale of why I started BrightLights!

My first four years out of college were spent as a financial advisor at Merrill Lynch, and I had a front row seat to the [Stock Market Crash of 2008](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%932008). I felt awful after I realized the causes of the crash (the greed of Wall Street and predatory lenders and the incompetence of our government and regulators) and wanted to see if I could help prevent another one, so I became a financial regulator ( [Mount up!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiWClZrJSZY) ).

I spent seven years as a financial regulator investigating fraud, money laundering, and the underbelly of penny stocks (think ""[The Wolf of Wall Street](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJzo5TDfamk)""). My investigations [resulted](https://www.brightlightsllc.com/accomplishments-at-finra/) in $35 million in fines and numerous people and firms being suspended or barred from the industry. While my job gave me purpose, I realized regulators only have the resources to go after the worst of the worst, and the vast majority of people with financial advisors are completely on their own. 

As a huge sports and...[Wizards fan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jz1TjCphXE)... the proverbial lightbulb went off after reading [story after story](https://www.brightlightsllc.com/why/) of fraud against pro athletes by their advisors: They're young, inexperienced with finance, surrounded by [corruption](https://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/20834050/the-story-how-fbi-brought-words-corruption), and flush with cash, and I [estimate](https://www.brightlightsllc.com/2017/05/10/the-cost-of-fraud-in-u-s-professional-sports/) they lose $300 million per year to fraud. When I realized no one was protecting pro athletes from fraud, BrightLights was born in 2017.

Since BrightLights began, I've had the good fortune of having many NBA clients (Top 10 picks, veterans, rookies) and other pro athlete clients and now seen enough to confirm the problem of fraud and financial exploitation is very serious. As BrightLights has grown, I've [partnered](http://sportsagentblog.com/2019/06/05/vaynersports-announces-partnership-with-brightlights/) with Gary Vaynerchuk's sports agency, VaynerSports, and been featured on Gary's ""[Daily Vee](https://youtu.be/3JGJXcMoA2w)"" vlog as well as other publications like The [Athletic](https://theathletic.com/video/11-dream-factory/) and an [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SETVD11FZYA) with CNBC contributor and the godfather of [financial Twitter](https://twitter.com/ReformedBroker), Josh Brown. BrightLights also has partnerships with the second biggest agency in the world, [Wasserman](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6521419761077809153/), as well as [Rep 1 Sports](https://www.brightlightsllc.com/rep1sports-announces-partnership-with-brightlights-financial-monitoring/), [Vanguard Sports Group](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/vanguard-sports-group-forms-strategic-alliance-with-brightlights-financial-monitoring-300583606.html), and worked with numerous other agents and agencies, such as Priority Sports, to help NBA players.

Plus, we can raise money for a good cause!

The past month I've been running a fundraiser called Dunk On Cancer, which has raised over $70,000, all of which will go toward cancer research at one of the world's leading research centers, the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. It's where my dad is receiving his treatment [after being diagnosed with Stage IV cancer in March](https://www.theringer.com/nba/2019/5/3/18527632/boston-celtics-playoffs-family).

Dunk On Cancer ends on Monday, so this is one last push to raise money.

I'd love to see NBA Reddit rise to the top of the Fundraiser Leaderboard. Currently, the Rights To Ricky Sanchez Podcast is in the lead with $10,738 raised.

It'd be even more amazing if we reached Dunk On Cancer's goal of $100,000. There are currently 30K people online. If everyone donated just $1 we'd get there. Let's go for it.

**To donate to Dunk On Cancer, go to [https://pledgeit.org/dunkoncancer/@NBAReddit](https://pledgeit.org/dunkoncancer/@NBAReddit)**. Any amount is appreciated. Thank you.

Anyway, ask away. Open to any questions about NBA rumors, draft, free agency, or anything random. I'm gonna answer as many questions as I can starting at 3PM EST until the evening, and then I'll keep responding periodically throughout the weekend.

Thanks everyone. Let's have fun with this and in the process raise money for a good cause.",2383,967,https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/c6nrw1

Ask me anything.",Bryan Oringher,NBA employee,NBA employee,"Hi, I'm Bryan Oringher. I worked in the NBA the past 7 seasons. For 4 years I was the Head Video Coordinator of the Washington Wizards. Last year I did Regional Advance Scouting for the Hawks and Raptors. This season, I tried out the media side of things. That either went great or awful, depending on who you ask. You can find me on Twitter [@ScoutWithBryan](https://twitter.com/ScoutWithBryan), and my content to date at [ScoutWithBryan.com](https://scoutwithbryan.com/).

As far as the polarizing side: I have over 7K followers. Many I think really enjoy my content. I did [two AMA's](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/a7ou6w/hi_reddit_my_name_is_bryan_oringher_and_i_spent/?sort=top) already, both of which I think went [really well](https://www.reddit.com/r/nbadiscussion/comments/b7qko9/hey_reddit_this_is_bryan_oringher_and_i_spent_the/). I caused some controversy with a WNBA tweet that was tone-deaf and I've since apologized profusely for, and for generally not getting along with many of the gatekeepers of NBATwitter. I told my side of the story [here](https://scoutwithbryan.com/blog/ether), and Deadspin was kind enough to have a conversation with me [here](https://deadspin.com/a-calm-but-occasionally-perplexing-interview-with-the-e-1835099065).

In this AMA, I'm legitimately happy to answer any lingering questions about me. I certainly have my fair share of detractors, and I'm not perfect and have made mistakes. All I ask is that you keep it respectful and honest - i.e. no questions like ""Why are you such an a-hole?"" or ""Why does everyone hate you?"" If you have a legitimate issue with my approach to something or someone -- ask about that specifically. I'm happy to address anything truthfully and maybe even clear up some of your misconceptions or some of the false info about me.

Bottom line: my goal has been to provide the most in-depth film breakdowns of basketball anywhere. My [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/scoutwithbryan) has breakdowns on Giannis, Steph, Luka, Harden, D-Wade, Manu, and many more, as well as draft scouts on Zion, Ja, RJ, Culver, etc. On Twitter, I keep it real, which sometimes clashes with the blog expert/ loudmouth talking head culture. My takes are all honest and real and derived from my experiences within basketball. I respect coaches having worked on that side and understanding how tough the position is, don't like the ever-changing narratives and ""what have you done for me lately"" evaluation of players, and generally dislike the incessant bashing and criticism that goes on in the outside world. I've aimed to be a resource to anyone trying to coach, get into basketball, or just watch the game at a greater level of detail or understanding. If you've enjoyed it or appreciate what I'm trying to do: your support on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/ScoutWithBryan) is greatly appreciated. Clickbait sells. Skip Bayless and memes dominate society. I'm trying to be rational and against the narrative nonsense. Since my stuff is too nuanced to get mainstream clicks, I appreciate my Patrons helping support me tremendously.

Yes, I only met KAT a few times but what he did in my limited time around him was enough for me to dislike him strongly. Doesn’t mean he’s a horrible person, but I’m not a fan of him. Don’t use this thread solely to make an opinion of him, this is just MY experience. No I can’t prove to you that this exact conversation happened. You’ll just have to take my word for it. I’m not trying to “expose” anyone but just engage in fun conversations with other fans and talk about things that personally surprised me 

Please refrain from trying to be a Reddit detective, it highly discourages me from wanting to do a part 2 now that I have several Reddit detectives trying to track me down based on a “Kyle singler looking mother fucker” description. If you send me threatening PMs, I’m just going to send you over to the mods. This is suppose to be a thread where we can laugh together at player dick sizes and Rondo making me run laps, not a negative thread. But I do apologize for negatively specific stories I.E KAT and Kidd, I will refrain from doing more of those in the future and just leave it more generic. 

I’m sorry I can’t answer PMs, I’m at lunch with a client and hiding in the bathroom to write this disclaimer lol. 

To all you lovely people who’ve made this fun: thank you! I hope we can continue this soon. Sorry that there’s some suckers who want to ruin everything but that’s just life! 

Have a great day/night everyone!

Ben Golliver, NBA writer for The Washington Post and the lesser half of the Open Floor podcast, back in the Reddit building.

We just posted a big and fun special project comparing LeBron James and Michael Jordan as scorers, given that LBJ is about to pass Mike on the NBA's all-time scoring list. I talked to a bunch of players who defended both and tried to capture their thoughts in the piece. It's linked up below.

I'm also here in Charlotte for All-Star Weekend. So AMA about our project that compares LBJ and MJ as scorers, and about anything else about All-Star Weekend or the upcoming playoff races, beginning at 1 p.m. Eastern time. Start throwing questions in here, and I'll be back in a bit!

sorry it's a little faded, from 14 years ago.  
  
AMA!!  

Okay I've gotten a few PM's asking for my story, here it is: 
We were in the upper deck seating. Pistons were down 15 or so with 3 minutes left I think. Me, my dad, and my brother got up to leave, and as we were going down the steps, we heard people shout. We ran back up, and heard people talking about how Ben Wallace have shoved Ron Artest. The next 2-3 minutes were pretty tense. Ben was pacing and angry. Ron Artest went over to the scorer's table and decided to lay down on it. The referees were not quick in getting the game started, and people began to boo and get louder. Although this is the point where a beer was thrown at Ron, you actually couldn't see that if you were a fan in the stadium. From our perspective, it appeared as though someone just heckled him or yelled at him, when he rushed into the stands to attack the person. This set off a chain reaction of fights, as ya'll have seen in the videos.  
  
The big difference between being there and watching replays is that nobody knew Artest had a beer thrown at him. I'm not saying that excuses him running into the stands to attack people. But you're looking at Ben Wallace angrily pacing around, Ron Artest laying on the scorer's table, refs trying to figure something out, Larry Brown yelling about something, you're talking to people next to you. Next thing you know Artest is running at fans and swinging at them, it became ""us vs. them"" instantly. It seemed like he just snapped and attacked.  
  
The mood in the stadium was actually not scary during most of the fight. People were cheering and clapping every time a fight broke out. I'm not saying the fighting was a good thing, I'm just saying that most people were not fearing for their life, or crying, or disgusted. Felt like WWE. There was a guy who was sitting up by us who said, ""FUCK THIS!"" We saw him run down the stairs. 5 minutes later, he was down behind the hoop, throwing chairs at the Pacers. We also snuck down there just to get closer. No security anywhere? We were near the tunnel where the Pacers exited, where people dumped popcorn and drinks on them. It was tough to keep track of everything at once. Where a Pacer and a fan were fighting, there were just as many areas where people were trying to get onto the court through perimeter security, or throwing chairs. The general mood in the Palace was pretty much ""I can do whatever the hell I want right now"" and ""This is fucking AWESOME!""
  
Also, my uncle was working court side security that game, he has a pretty crazy perspective of it too. He said their training that year focused on not going on the court until the game was finished. The reason fans were able to just waltz onto the court and try to punch players was because the security was nervous if they stepped on the court they would be violating orders (since there was still 2-3 minutes left on the game clock). Obviously they should have gone out there and stopped all the fighting, but that is why is happened like that.   
   
After the game: Everyone was calling their friends and family in the parking lot telling them to turn on ESPN or their nightly news. People were all lingering in the parking lot talking to each other. Everyone was claiming to have punched a Pacer. ""I punched Artest"" ""That's nothing I punched Jackson!"" In the stadium, it was just craziness and going wild and laughing. But when we got out to the fresh air and collected our thoughts, we started to realize how big an event it was.

Let’s talk basketball – or, y’know, whatever. I cover the NBA for Sports Illustrated, where I’ve recently written stories on [the split performance of Ben Simmons](https://www.si.com/nba/2018/01/10/philadelphia-76ers-ben-simmons-joel-embiid-brett-brown), [Indiana’s surprising success coming out of timeouts](https://www.si.com/nba/2018/01/18/pacers-nate-mcmillan-victor-oladipo-timeout-offense-plays), and [all the subtle ways the Warriors are evolving](https://www.si.com/nba/2018/01/05/warriors-stephen-curry-kevin-durant-klay-thompson-stats-schedule).

I also host and produce Breakaway, a narrative podcast about how the NBA works. Breakaway debuts its second season tomorrow, January 25, with an in-depth look at team chemistry and the dynamics of an NBA locker room, starring the suddenly newsy Damian Lillard. You’ll be able to find that episode on SI.com, [the show’s iTunes feed](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/breakaway/id1202998858?mt), or your podcast app of choice. New episodes are posted every other week, and baked goods will be shipped to those who subscribe and leave us a review.

I’ll start answering questions around 3 PM eastern.

Earlier this week I wrote about No. 1 pick Markelle Fultz. [Here's the story](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2017/sports/markelle-fultz-ebony-nba-draft-2017/?utm_term=.01571753562e), and a little background about it.

About a year ago, The Washington Post passed over Markelle as the D.C. area boys' basketball player of the year. He hasn't forgotten that. “I should’ve won it twice in a row,” he told reporter me recently. From being cut from his high school varsity team to becoming the No. 1 pick in the NBA draft, Fultz has blazed his own trail, fueled by a desire to prove others wrong. And while Lonzo Ball and his father dominate headlines, Markelle’s quiet ambition — the fuel for which can come from unusual places — propelled him up draft boards to become the first player from Washington, D.C., to go first overall since 1971. I spent a lot of time with Fultz and those closest to him.

We're going to do this AMA at 1 p.m. You can ask me about the draft, or anything NBA really. We'll be ready to go then!

Ask Me Anything!",Yaroslav Korolev,Retired player,Retired player,"Greetings Reddit. I am Yaroslav Korolev. I was taken 12th overall by the Los Angeles Clippers in 2005, which made me the highest (and youngest) Russian player ever drafted. After a brief time in the NBA, I spent the next 9 years playing on various European teams in countries such as Russia, Spain, and Greece. The year before I was drafted, I won the Russian Cup with CSKA Moscow. 

A few years ago, I helped to co-found Royal Basketball School, a youth basketball program that follows the same step-by-step instructions that my father used to teach me the game. In only 6 years, we have already reached 300+ players and 8 locations all across Los Angeles. For the first years, I would bounce back and forth; playing overseas during the season and coaching during the offseason. After playing last season for Basket Navarra (Spain), I decided to hang up my jersey for good in exchange for a whistle and a clipboard. 

Apparently, my friend Timofey Mozgov hosted one of these before. He seemed to have a really fun time, so I wanted to try it out myself.
